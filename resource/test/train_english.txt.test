I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms . I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two handfuls every time you feel hungry . The food is nutritionally complete, (certified), so it works well and I was going to try it again .

Sam's Club won't let me shop there anymore . Better watch what you ask retired people . They have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say .

I'm notorious among my circle of friends for telling " terrible puns/jokes " I think it's amazing, but I'd been rolling them out all day, patience for puns must've gotten shortened . I'm talking with Shorty (named because she had short hair) and she was telling me about a book she had started . Shorty " So the book's called 'Cutting for Stone' and it's like a doctor drama kinda thing, the only issue is that that it's super heavy on the medical terminology, so many bloody surgeries and procedures are listed, and I don't really know anything about that kids stuff . Like it's got an interesting plot but I don't know if I can't finish it, I'm not to sure I'm cut out for it " At that last line I began laughing (her pun was unintentional) and compliment her on it " ha that was good . You're not 'cut out' for it " Shorty " Oh god that was terrible just stop " Me " You want me to 'cut' it out? " Shorty " I'm going to kill you if you keep this up woman " Me " You're gonna 'cut' me up? " Shorty " Your jokes are terrible and it's proven that puns make people angry " At this point I was just rolling in my chair laughing I really couldn't keep it together, possibly the best reply rolls through my head after this comment, I crack up, there I am choking out as tears come to my eyes . " Well it's a good thing it's not a PUNishable offense " The girl next to me starts laughing as shorty yells at me how I can't just start crying at my own jokes . TLDR; A witty banter of sharper than usual humor, as I walk a razor thin line of pissing off my friend and pissing myself with laughter . I have many other stories so I titled this part one,if anybody likes my writing and jokes I'll share the rest !

The news spread in under an hour in both areas, and people were freaking out . People thought that Ebola was spreading around in the Illinois Valley, and since Ottawa is on the Fox River(which flows towards the Suburbs unlike the Illinois river, also, people thought that the disease would go towards Aurora and infect the Chicago suburbs .

People will probably realize that it was a hoax before the day is over, but I we all got a major laugh . Now, I do not know about my friends, but I feel pretty badly about scaring 50 . 000 people .

" My dad thinks on it for a second . " Well no, sir, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night . " He got the job immediately . ([For those needing the reference](http://www . youtube . com/watch?v=wm-h7YR_410)) . Thanks for caring to read .

ID	1	[UPDATE] April Fools Day Femi-Nazi Prank Well howdy guys, I finally got my phone back today and decided i'd give you guys an update on what went down and what definitely did not go down . I am not dead, no, but I was socially dead for the past week because I had some troubles with the Police . Anyways this is how it went down (Written quickly, have to go really soon but I'll reply ASAP) . I rolled into the school and had an easy day . Simple classes, simple courses, it all went amazingly . Anyways school ends and you know the drill . Bells ring, halls are filled with people, and as i'm leaving the school I remember the prank . I fix myself up and walk through the office door, walking with purpose and all that jazz . Anyways I walked through the main office, down the hall, and into the Principles office where the PA is . She wasn't in and I hadn't rehearsed anything so I just went for " The mens-rights committee has a meeting today at 3:15 . Today's activity will be making cat calls at socially awkward girls . Thank you, and have a good day " . Cue me sprinting through the hallways, some people laughing their ass off while femi-nazis chased me like Temple Run . I got out and went home, all was well and dandy until I got to school the next day . Police were there and wanted to speak to me about some " Bullying " I had performed against a large group of women . Anyways it went on over the next 4 days, constantly going in and out, parents being contacted and lame stuff . I had to make statements, apologies, and had to clear up things . It was a joke and should've been treated as such . Luckily, in the end, it was . April Fools Day saved my ass because any other day I wouldn't have had that inch of lee-way . Oh- and one of the girls assaulted me in math class . So she took a ton of flak for a day and had to kiss my ass for physical assault with a weapon (A binder) . Well- Any questions? All in all it went really lamely, and I feel bad that it wasn't as spectacular as it sounded . Also I have a cut on my forearm from where she slashed me . On a more positive note, one of that girl's biggest enemies thought it was hilarious and we started talking . Peace guys !

ID	0	A while back there was an opening in the CIA for an assassin A while back there was an opening in the CIA for an assassin . These highly classified positions are extremely difficult to fill, requiring an extensive background check, training, and testing before candidates are even considered for the position . After reviewing several applicants and completing all the checks and training, the field was narrowed to the three most promising candidates . The day came for the final test, which would determine which of equally qualified candidates, would get the job . The final candidates consisted of two men and one woman . The men administering the test took the first candidate, a man, down a corridor to a closed door and handed him a gun saying, " We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances . Inside this room you will find your wife, seated in a chair . Take this gun and kill her . " The man, looking completely shocked said, " You can't be serious ! I could never kill my wife . " The CIA man said, " Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job . Take your wife and go home . " They brought the next candidate in, the other man, and repeated the instructions . This man took the gun, walked into the room and closed the door . However, after five minutes of silence, the door opened and the man handed the CIA tester the gun, saying, " I just couldn't do it . I couldn't kill my wife . I tried to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it . " The CIA man said, " Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job . Take your wife and go home . " Then they brought the woman down the corridor to the closed door, handed her a gun, and said, " We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances . Inside this room you will find your husband, seated in a chair . Take this gun and kill him . " The woman took the gun, walked into the room, and before the door closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing . One shot after another, for thirteen shots, the noise continued . Then all hell broke loose . For the next several minutes, the men heard screaming, cursing, furniture crashing and banging on the walls; then suddenly, silence . The door opened slowly and there stood the woman . She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, " You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks ! I had to beat him to death with the chair ! "

We find ourselves at a loss when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt ! ' Well, thanks to my personal genealogy research efforts, you can now respond in an intellectual way . Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt . Awe Schitt was married to O . Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, and owner of Needeep N . Schitt, Inc . They had one son, Jack . In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt . The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt . Against her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout . After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced . Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name . She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock . Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition who was nick-named Chicken Schitt . Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony . The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials . The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Horse . Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world . He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt . Now when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt,' you can correct them . Sincerely, Crock O . Schitt

Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late . So, where are you staying in Rome? " " We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's Tiber River called Teste . " " Don't go any further . I know that place .

ID	0	A dad joke, taken too far . Back in the late 80's, my dad had a joke he loved to tell everyone he met . It went something like this:I was driving down the road and ended up behind this ambulance with its rear door open . I tried honking and flashing my lights to get their attention about it, but they didn't seem to notice . As they turned the corner away from us, a small cooler fell out . I pulled over to rescue the cooler, and when I opened it, I found a human toe, on ice . At this point, the victim of the joke is supposed to ask what he did with the toe . He responds with " I called the Tow Truck ! " and hearty laughter . Being the 1980's, e-mail wasn't prevalent, and calling long distance could get expensive, so he communicated with his out of state family primarily through mailed letters . He wrote this joke (sans punchline) in a letter to his mom . Not knowing it was a joke, she told the story to her friends and family . My aunt heard this story, and told it to her classes (she's a teacher) and one of her students actually got in a fight with his mom who said that could never happen . A month or two later, we were getting together for a holiday and the toe story came up in conversation . My dad replied that he called the tow truck, and his laughter was met with horrified stares . By this time, nearly everyone in the small town was enthralled with this amazing story that my grandma had told about her son who lived in the city . She was imagining all of the people she had to contact to tell the real story to . Many took it in stride, but others were quite annoyed . Especially my aunt, who had to apologize to every one of her classes at school . TLDR: A dad joke with no punch line doesn't belong in a letter .
