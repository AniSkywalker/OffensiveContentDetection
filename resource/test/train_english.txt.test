I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms . I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two handfuls every time you feel hungry . The food is nutritionally complete, (certified), so it works well and I was going to try it again . (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story . ) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care,because the dog food poisoned me .

Sam's Club won't let me shop there anymore . Better watch what you ask retired people . They have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say .

I'm notorious among my circle of friends for telling " terrible puns/jokes " I think it's amazing, but I'd been rolling them out all day, patience for puns must've gotten shortened . I'm talking with Shorty (named because she had short hair) and she was telling me about a book she had started . Shorty " So the book's called 'Cutting for Stone' and it's like a doctor drama kinda thing, the only issue is that that it's super heavy on the medical terminology, so many bloody surgeries and procedures are listed, and I don't really know anything about that kids stuff . Like it's got an interesting plot but I don't know if I can't finish it, I'm not to sure I'm cut out for it " At that last line I began laughing (her pun was unintentional) and compliment her on it " ha that was good . You're not 'cut out' for it " Shorty " Oh god that was terrible just stop " Me " You want me to 'cut' it out? " Shorty " I'm going to kill you if you keep this up woman " Me " You're gonna 'cut' me up? " Shorty " Your jokes are terrible and it's proven that puns make people angry " At this point I was just rolling in my chair laughing I really couldn't keep it together, possibly the best reply rolls through my head after this comment, I crack up, there I am choking out as tears come to my eyes . " Well it's a good thing it's not a PUNishable offense " The girl next to me starts laughing as shorty yells at me how I can't just start crying at my own jokes . TLDR; A witty banter of sharper than usual humor, as I walk a razor thin line of pissing off my friend and pissing myself with laughter . I have many other stories so I titled this part one,if anybody likes my writing and jokes I'll share the rest !

ID	1	[UPDATE] April Fools Day Femi-Nazi Prank Well howdy guys, I finally got my phone back today and decided i'd give you guys an update on what went down and what definitely did not go down . I am not dead, no, but I was socially dead for the past week because I had some troubles with the Police . Anyways this is how it went down (Written quickly, have to go really soon but I'll reply ASAP) . I rolled into the school and had an easy day . Simple classes, simple courses, it all went amazingly . Anyways school ends and you know the drill . Bells ring, halls are filled with people, and as i'm leaving the school I remember the prank . I fix myself up and walk through the office door, walking with purpose and all that jazz . Anyways I walked through the main office, down the hall, and into the Principles office where the PA is . She wasn't in and I hadn't rehearsed anything so I just went for " The mens-rights committee has a meeting today at 3:15 . Today's activity will be making cat calls at socially awkward girls . Thank you, and have a good day " . Cue me sprinting through the hallways, some people laughing their ass off while femi-nazis chased me like Temple Run . I got out and went home, all was well and dandy until I got to school the next day . Police were there and wanted to speak to me about some " Bullying " I had performed against a large group of women . Anyways it went on over the next 4 days, constantly going in and out, parents being contacted and lame stuff . I had to make statements, apologies, and had to clear up things . It was a joke and should've been treated as such . Luckily, in the end, it was . April Fools Day saved my ass because any other day I wouldn't have had that inch of lee-way . Oh- and one of the girls assaulted me in math class . So she took a ton of flak for a day and had to kiss my ass for physical assault with a weapon (A binder) . Well- Any questions? All in all it went really lamely, and I feel bad that it wasn't as spectacular as it sounded . Also I have a cut on my forearm from where she slashed me . On a more positive note, one of that girl's biggest enemies thought it was hilarious and we started talking . Peace guys !

ID	0	A while back there was an opening in the CIA for an assassin A while back there was an opening in the CIA for an assassin . These highly classified positions are extremely difficult to fill, requiring an extensive background check, training, and testing before candidates are even considered for the position . After reviewing several applicants and completing all the checks and training, the field was narrowed to the three most promising candidates . The day came for the final test, which would determine which of equally qualified candidates, would get the job . The final candidates consisted of two men and one woman . The men administering the test took the first candidate, a man, down a corridor to a closed door and handed him a gun saying, " We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances . Inside this room you will find your wife, seated in a chair . Take this gun and kill her . " The man, looking completely shocked said, " You can't be serious ! I could never kill my wife . " The CIA man said, " Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job . Take your wife and go home . " They brought the next candidate in, the other man, and repeated the instructions . This man took the gun, walked into the room and closed the door . However, after five minutes of silence, the door opened and the man handed the CIA tester the gun, saying, " I just couldn't do it . I couldn't kill my wife . I tried to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it . " The CIA man said, " Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job . Take your wife and go home . " Then they brought the woman down the corridor to the closed door, handed her a gun, and said, " We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances . Inside this room you will find your husband, seated in a chair . Take this gun and kill him . " The woman took the gun, walked into the room, and before the door closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing . One shot after another, for thirteen shots, the noise continued . Then all hell broke loose . For the next several minutes, the men heard screaming, cursing, furniture crashing and banging on the walls; then suddenly, silence . The door opened slowly and there stood the woman . She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, " You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks ! I had to beat him to death with the chair ! "

It is literally being held up by a few 2x4's . I look at my husband with the saddest look I can muster before I say " Babe, did you see that poor palm? " . Husband says, " Oh yea, that big, dead-looking ones with the boards? " . I respond, " Yea, sweetie, we should say a prayer . The poor thing is on LEAF support " . He was not amused ... I, however, giggle every other Saturday when we pass the tree to game day . Also, please don't worry about the tree . Now that Phoenix has made it through a hot summer, I bet after winter it will just spring back to life ... assuming it doesn't fall . Lastly, sorry I'm not a dad or no actually dad said it ... but I was channeling that inner dad when it happened ! If I need to move this post it is okay !

Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt . Awe Schitt was married to O . Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, and owner of Needeep N . Schitt, Inc . They had one son, Jack . In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt . The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt . Against her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout . After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced . Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name . She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock . Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition who was nick-named Chicken Schitt . Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony . The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials . The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Horse . Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world . He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt . Now when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt,' you can correct them . Sincerely, Crock O . Schitt

Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late . So, where are you staying in Rome? " " We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's Tiber River called Teste . " " Don't go any further . I know that place .

You're going to need it . " A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo . The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome .

The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot .. And the hotel was great !

ID	0	A dad joke, taken too far . Back in the late 80's, my dad had a joke he loved to tell everyone he met . It went something like this:I was driving down the road and ended up behind this ambulance with its rear door open . I tried honking and flashing my lights to get their attention about it, but they didn't seem to notice . As they turned the corner away from us, a small cooler fell out . I pulled over to rescue the cooler, and when I opened it, I found a human toe, on ice . At this point, the victim of the joke is supposed to ask what he did with the toe . He responds with " I called the Tow Truck ! " and hearty laughter . Being the 1980's, e-mail wasn't prevalent, and calling long distance could get expensive, so he communicated with his out of state family primarily through mailed letters . He wrote this joke (sans punchline) in a letter to his mom . Not knowing it was a joke, she told the story to her friends and family . My aunt heard this story, and told it to her classes (she's a teacher) and one of her students actually got in a fight with his mom who said that could never happen . A month or two later, we were getting together for a holiday and the toe story came up in conversation . My dad replied that he called the tow truck, and his laughter was met with horrified stares . By this time, nearly everyone in the small town was enthralled with this amazing story that my grandma had told about her son who lived in the city . She was imagining all of the people she had to contact to tell the real story to . Many took it in stride, but others were quite annoyed . Especially my aunt, who had to apologize to every one of her classes at school . TLDR: A dad joke with no punch line doesn't belong in a letter .
