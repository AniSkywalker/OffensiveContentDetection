TrainSen	1	You fuck your dad.
TrainSen	0	i really don't understand your point. It seems that you are mixing apples and oranges.
TrainSen	0	A\majority of Canadians can and has been wrong before now and will be again. Unless you're supportive of the idea that nothing is full proof or perfect so you take your chances and if we should inadvertently kill your son or daughter then them's the breaks and we can always regard you as collateral damage like in wartime - and sorry, but\the cheques in the mail. 
TrainSen	0	listen if you dont wanna get married to a man or a women DONT DO IT. what would it bother you if gay people got married stay in your lane do you let them do them. And your god is so nice but quick to judg if your not like him, thought you wasnt suppose to judge people.
TrainSen	0	@SDL OK, but I would hope they'd sign him to a one-year contract to start with. Give him the chance to be reliable and productive, but give themselves the out if all his time off has hurt his playing skills or if he falls back into old habits.
TrainSen	0	Yeah and where are you now?
TrainSen	1	shut the fuck up. you and the rest of your faggot friends should be burned at the stake
TrainSen	1	Either you are fake or extremely stupid...maybe both...

TrainSen	0	To all those doom-and-gloomers, the chicken-littles who claim the sky is falling and that society is collapsing...Canada has had gay marriage nationwide for years. Where is the disaster? Where is the collapse and the persecution you're shouting about? Where is it? Please, show us some examples because it's starting to look like your threats and fears and warnings are nothing but HOT AIR.
TrainSen	0	Craig, we have been saying from the start that this is a very entertaining show. It awakens the horny little Goth in me. I met my boyfriend during the first season and one of the first thing we did was watch AHS at my house. I know he likes me and all but to this day he is sure I am far creepier and kinkier than he could ever be. Thanks, American Horror Story. Sweet Clam loves you.
TrainSen	0	Strange you are talking about that when there were Chelsea fans in here belittling the Community Shield

TrainSen	0	oh cool, some more internet points for your collection!
TrainSen	0	Even though I think there are better coaches out there, I am glad Del Negro is keeping his job. I never thought he got enough credit those years when he took those average Chicago Bulls teams he coached to the playoffs 2 years in a row
TrainSen	0	russellpiano Hmmmm...how can we spin Obama honoring Vietnam troops as something negative.Answer: Doesn't matter! Look at our followers. They'll take anything. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Obama team: "Hmmm, how can we make the liberal Messiah look better in light of the revelations of his leaking classified information to the New York Times?I know, lets have a bogus photo shoot at the Viet Nam Memorial. That will make Obama look like he cares about vets (but first we'll have to clear all the vets out of the immediate area because they can't be trusted)."
TrainSen	0	A good article, which, for all the good it will do, could have been delivered to a brick wall.
TrainSen	0	Head's up warning...another source of funding for Media Matters is Peter Lewis of the Progessive Insurance Company. You know, those auto insurance commercials that run every 5 minutes on cable television featuring the gal who looks like a blow-up doll with red lips and\a perfectly round mouth...if you know what I mean.IF you have Progressive\auto insurance, just know that part of your premium is going to fund a progressive liberal\organization hell bent\on destroying\our country and our free speech. Their mission is to\bring down\Hannity,Beck,Dobbs,Lavin,Limbaugh,Boortz,etc. We must not let them win.

TrainSen	0	The only "other" relevant fact is that HE IS DESTROYING AMERICA!
TrainSen	0	You are a liar.
TrainSen	1	Is that it?? your sum total to any conversation is first abuse and then calling them a troll.. You are a typical socialist idiot. Keep up your non existent class warfare, it is as pointless as you.
TrainSen	0	@beanstalk @briview Welp then NBW right?
TrainSen	0	Good job, fellas. I didn't quite read the rules about a signature piece, but I guess that was as good as any. I found some great blogs to follow, and to share over at G+. If I'm not commenting on your blogs, it's because I always throw my two cents in when I post my share. Add me on there if you are a Googler. https://plus.google.com/109258118458627782001/posts. Again, congratulations to the winners, and I hope we get the chance to submit something else. This was fucking fun.
TrainSen	0	I say hang is ass in the center of the town to let it be known that this type of behavior gets this type of punishment... The lady had a kid 1 week ago. Women aren't safe to have sex after child birth for AT LEAST 6 weeks. So even if this WAS\consensual, it would have been wayyyyy too soon and hurt the lady. I am so glad the the baby is so young and will not remember this event happening in it's house and I hope the mother recovers quickly.
TrainSen	1	faggot
TrainSen	0	You right if you are relaxe then you can give better result or perform and your identity should be from your work.
TrainSen	1	Aimless Abe you are a delusion weirdo that should be locked up inside and kept away from computers. Anyone who doubts the lunacy of Abe the moronic prog frog from NYC please read this thread and you will see Abe completely come apart from the seams and go off the deep end.
TrainSen	0	That, I do not doubt... ...as a Blackberry clone. But, your original argument was not that Android would have existed, just that Android somehow predates iOS development.
TrainSen	0	OKC should work out a deal to get a PG who plays more like Parker or CP3. I think Nash at the point, and move Westbrook to SG that team would be unstoppable. Imagine the shots Nash would create for Durant. Then Westbrook would be at his natural position too, the guy doesn't create shots or distribute.
TrainSen	0	Maher's show goes on and on... Palin's Alakda show gets canceled. Isn't the "free market" wonderful?
TrainSen	1	Even as a troll you are a pathetic failure.
TrainSen	0	Grazie mille Sabrina! Sei cos\xec dolce. Baci.
TrainSen	0	yeah well, it would still be better than letting them sit there for 20-30 years on my dime before sticking a needle in their veins. I say give them ALL a noose. If they choose to kill themselves, so be it.
TrainSen	0	um holy fuck i need a cigarette

TrainSen	0	I don't know if Lewis is a little boy or little girl. Either way it becomes the third on my list of petulant idiots. You will understand when you grow up. Ask an old bastard member of your family to explain. Such actions cannot be tolerated. How come you blame the line judge? Weird.
TrainSen	0	thats a pathetic flop fuck you jvg
TrainSen	0	Why should they bother improving ios if they sell more phones than they care to produce. These advice are better served to the also-runs... wp first and foremost
TrainSen	0	spursruss: I live in Argentina and its not all Argentinians. The problem being those who are loud on the issue are ill educated and you can be sure they wouldn't be rushing to fight anyone, they would be cowering in the background. My wife is Argentinean and she is the first one to recognize the stupidity of the claims. Some of muppet think they fought their Independence against the UK, morons the lot of them. The answer is simple, if we were the leading colonial force, you would be an ENGLISH speaking country, you aren't, because werent it was Spain, Portugal, France, our interests were commercial. Also the worst part is they themselves exterminated the natives, the Spanish started it but actually it was the newly formed Argies which did most of the killing of the native, lovely eh? Clueless stuff, you wonder why the Government gets away with corruption, so many ignorant people thats why...you shouldnt judge ALL by the standard, these a huge amount of Argies who see the Cristina drum beating for what it is, the same as ALL presidents of Argentina do, using it to cover their failing.
TrainSen	0	you better hope because the Marlins have a history of giving up their superstars
TrainSen	0	Well, you guys have gone and done it now. You put the words 'China' and 'Chinese' up the required number of times for the dating Asians ad to come up. Evidently, Ms. Zhang, 50Kg and 168cm [for a BMI of 17.8] from 'HuNan China' wants to meet me. She has her little mouth open like she's speaking. What's that you ask, Zhang? Well, yes, as a matter of fact I am a physician. Why are you clapping your hands together and jumping up and down? Stop that squealing, young lady and 'exprain' yourself!
TrainSen	0	you mean like your off topic Obama rant bellow?

TrainSen	0	I like your comments. However I would go one step further. It's not time to "let" the people of IL fight back. Rather the citizens of IL just need to fight back period. I will carry next time I travel into "little Beirut". i.e. Chicago
TrainSen	1	Fact : Georgia passed a strict immigration policy and most of the Latino farm workers left the area. Vidalia Georgia now has over 3000 agriculture job openings and they have been able to fill about 250 of them in past year. All you White Real Americans who are looking for work that the Latinos stole from you..Where are you ? The jobs are i Vadalia just waiting for you..Or maybe its the fact that you would rather collect unemployment like the rest of the Tea Klaners.. You scream..you complain..and you sit at home in your wife beaters and drink beer..Typical Real White Tea Klan...
TrainSen	1	Of course you would bottom feeder ...
TrainSen	1	You are a fukin moron. You are just butthurt that you got rejected on WIkipedia. Call yoursilf scolar or whatever. I am better than you, just 14 and already a Wikipedia administrator. You are just a stupid ashole.
TrainSen	0	He is doing what any president doe's on this day. I do not recall if other presidents appeared at the Wall. election year... yea, but then again you would never say anything if he did not appear. You can not have it both ways.
TrainSen	0	...yeah, and you're a f'ing expert...go back to picking through trash barrels you tool
TrainSen	0	Those trails will definitely get plowed regardless of the investigation. They'll just see it as easier to plow the area than deal with it. And once they got plowed I would never return or risk getting stopped and heavily questioned by the PO-PO's. P.S. - All the stupid comments are unnecessary. It's really easy to be cold and heartless and act like you don't give a fuck. But I'd like to see these anonymous commentators talk shit like that in front of this person's family or even their own Mother's. Grow up children and learn some respect.
TrainSen	0	Suh had a sack the last time they played.
TrainSen	0	and you are support argument a-hole... Not everyone games on their pc's either. Spec whores miss the point entirely... I prefer the mac to my daily work. That beings said, I'm also a big believer in the best tool for the job and there are certain things that PC's do better, (Database and servers for instance) The thing is that you havent proved anything other than an anti apple bias and name calling (guilty myself to get your attention) id just juvenile
TrainSen	1	You are a fucking dumb ass!. Go back to you Xbox dickhead. Grow up you little fanboy.
TrainSen	0	you know what would be fun? If you guys talked crap back to us. more entertaining

TrainSen	0	YOLO. This is hilarious. Canyon students are so racist! Even though most of us are Mexican! Fuck gabby!
TrainSen	1	Lets see your papers arealconservati. Till then shut the fuuk up sticky-chin.
TrainSen	0	An interesting angle of organized religion is that religious persecution is never ok unless your defending your own religion.You all aren't victims of religious oppression.You are the oppressors.BTW, i'm not gay.I just love how you people try to defend your persecution of others while claiming your are being persecuted.
TrainSen	1	Correction Bitch! You don't think it's superb because your hating ass doesn't know talent..And Again I am still waiting on you to submit a video of you singing..Where is the youtube link? I am sure you will get all kinds of rave reviews lol
TrainSen	1	I think the only trickle that effected you was the trickle of sperm your dad gave your mom and most of that trickled down her leg. Go back to sleep, we will wake you when you are needed again.
TrainSen	1	And you keep on your knees and keep telling yourself that is a sausage in your mouth. And that is cream cheese you are swallowing.
TrainSen	0	What was that, like 2000 words about nothing? You're going after Andrea Mitchell? What, was Fox infomercial not broadcasting yesterday? How about the apologies issued for the "EPA drones"? And yet here you are attacking Andrea Mitchell about some stupid gas station gimmick. Here's another newsflash for you, Mr. Romney (R1%) is out of touch. We all already know it. Mr. Romney's amazement wasn't just about some gadget at a "petrol filling post" but that people could actually buy food products there and that they actually eat it. This very second Mr. Romney isn't even carrying a wallet. And it is very likely that he doesn't even know where it is. I'm still waiting for someone to ask him the tough campaign trail question of "how much does a gallon of milk cost?". Andrea Mitchell and gas station food... unbelievable.
TrainSen	0	@Rourke needs to give me a fucking like@jwoude23hows everyone doin?
TrainSen	1	fuck you both
TrainSen	0	Powers, MSNBC Is far far more biased and hostile in it's comments than FOX. At least at FOX there are usually opposing views. MSNBC is just a shill for the president. And they keep having to fire their hosts for all the outrageous remarks they make. Now, CNN is getting almost as bad as MSNBC.
TrainSen	0	What horrible trades are you talking about?

TrainSen	0	Not a big fan of Rondo, but the dude can ball...I wouldn't classify him as a big talker, just trying to psyche himself up...
TrainSen	1	Pig Maher, you forgot your meds again. You know you are one sick SOB so don't forget.
TrainSen	0	It's not just the rich screaming about taxes. It's the average middle class American who pays his/her taxes and doesn't see the benefit of those taxes (but instead sees waste). I pay federal taxes, but I don't use public schools, I'm not collecting any govt welfare or benefits, I pay for my own healthcare etc. I use the roads and sewers, so I don't mind paying the city taxesfor that. My trash pick up is private, so I pay that directly to the trash company.Everyone should pay for what they'use', notbased on what they make.Ifone wants to be a part of society, one shouldcontribute and pay their fair share. That includes the rich or poor.
TrainSen	1	Mr. King isn't it about time you either grow a pair of balls or join the democrats who will love a pussy cat like you.
TrainSen	0	I'm amused by the fact that WeBlog cons drop any issue once it turns into a loser. This is an expression of that amusement.
TrainSen	0	Gabriel.\Getting time to blow that horn?
TrainSen	0	Exactly. Like, I don't really give a shit how fat a person may or may not feel, but it really is shitty when your clothes don't fit. And not in a "I'm so gross" way but in a "I can't very well leave the house naked!!" way.

TrainSen	0	POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: Political Correctness is a doctrine, fostered by a delusional, illogical minority, and rapidly promoted by an unscrupulous lamestream media, which holds forth the proposition that it is entirely possible to pick up a piece of ch*t by the clean end.

TrainSen	0	The ignorance here is astounding. Clearly it says in the video that Cleveland was ALREADY convicted of rape and is serving jail time for it. He's GUILTY. She WAS RAPED!! (for all of the morons who've said ugly statements about her or attacked the veracity of her story) The only determination that this court is trying to make is whether Cash Money should be held liable. I think it's reasonable that when you invite someone to make a professional presentation at YOUR company that YOU provide necessary protections for that individual. I don't care whether Cleveland was employed or just "a hanger-on" a professional guest should not have been left unattended in the hands of someone dangerous that was there admittedly with Baby and Slim's knowledge and permission. If you went to a store and were attacked by an employee or a "friend of the boss" (who was permitted to hang around premises), would you not hold the company responsible?\

TrainSen	1	My best friend who is allergic to wheat, corn, soy, red dye, yellow dye, pistachios, tree nuts, kiwis, cherries, oranges, bananas, and seafood. If she gets anywhere near the smell of seafood her lungs constrict and she can no longer breath. Last week she got cut by a dog leash that had pistachios on it and almost went into anaphylactic. I know a little about food allergies. I asked my friend if she thought it was rude and selfish of someone to want food allergies so they could die. She said you are a bitch. So I do not really think it is insulting that she wants food allergies so she can die. I think we're back to you're a bitch.

TrainSen	0	The tirade isn't what people caused people to dislike her. Read her comments. Like this one, "I know of her story and her husband. We all have stories. I mean, I almost died, and Venus is struggling herself. So, you know, it's life. " She comes across as uncaring and selfish. On top of that she never gives an opponent any credit--it's always about what SHE did. I absolutely like Venus--consistently root for her and have for years--but Serena is an absolutely awful person that needs to grow up
TrainSen	0	Stacy C. is right - Dumbama and his fat-ass wife and their cronies have created this atmosphere of govt. interference and what they feel govt entities should be doing.Schools and others take their cues from the top down, and when they see this admin. forcing restaurants to publish calories on menus, then they feel they should be doing "their part" for their messiah and become food police.I cannot believe that a school puts out an approved food list.\I would be suing.\

TrainSen	0	You could not be more wrong. The American Tea Party stands for limited government. Fiscal responsibility, and a return to our constitution. The Tea Party when it rallies or protests does it legally with brains. We pay the permits, arrange the events, say our piece, and then clean up and go home. The occupukes on the other hand. Are not only different, they are opposite. They trespass, they steal, they show up without permission. They damage private property, they collect urine and feces to throw on people. They set fires, they smash store windows. They rape young girls. I can go on and on. Oh and the heat, AC and warm beds were all paid for by those people. don't kid yourself that we are not committed to our cause because we are not stupid like you or OWS. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. You and the occupunks have choosen the later.
TrainSen	0	Because that is how they get their rocks off. Our government is run by pedophiles who sexually torture children.
TrainSen	0	He actually said "what a spoiled bitch I am". I never hated Colton the way most of the posters did, because I felt for him. Being gay in a republican family, can only mean that you have been villified. He was dismayed that it was men vs women, as that took away any comfort zone he may have had. The men didn't welcome him, and when he got power, it went to his "spoiled bitch" head.

TRYING - Since when does a Sovereign have problems TRYING to deport diseased minded scum like him. Stuff the EU laws and if the UK is 'fined' by the EUSSR for doing this then don't pay it ... and then stop all financial payments to this corrupt experiment. It doesn't work, its broke so listen to the PEOPLE Camoron and have an in or out referendum .. NOW!
TrainSen	0	@nilbymouth You are right concerning Campbell. My bad. The QB carosel has me mixed up. Anyways, I still don't like Knapp and think we went that road with him once before and do not need to revisit it again. Cable obviously did not think too high of him if he stripped his playcalling duties and decided to call the plays himself. If Knapp was truely great at what he does, he would have had some positive influence on this team with his quarterbacks, and in my opinion, he didn't...Carson Palmer needs a guy like Saunders whose offensive connection to him is undeniable...

TrainSen	0	This is so American. Load of utter 'positive people makes positive lives' fake christian bullshit. Put it this way, take 2 for example:Give up complaining. This to me just reads like 'become a walk over'. If we all gave up complaining, nothing great would get done or crap would be accepted. Go into a hairdressers, get a shit haircut for $100. Don't complain because you are a happy, pissed-off with your shit haircut, person who's just been taken for a ride.Give up the luxury of criticism. For a start it's not a luxury. You can be critical if you want. I believe it is a trait that I enjoy. Why? Many people are idiots. It's the truth. If you are in a job and you don't criticise people who do crap work then you'll have an office/workplace full of people who can't do their job.These are basic personality traits of intelligent people. But I guess retards are happier than all of us.

TrainSen	0	I am a moderate. I am fiscally conservative but am moderate on the social issues. The Republican Party is no longer the party of Goldwater, Teddy Rooseveltnor even Reagan. The GOP is the party of Jerry Falwell, Tony Perkins and people like Michelle Bachmann. Because I am gay and can not find a place in the GOP, I voted for Obama in '08. However, this year I\am considering voting for Romney this year. Republicans better hope Romney gets the nomination because Santorum would be handing the election to Obama. Santorum is\SCARY conservative. He wants the government to be all up in peoples' business and I wouldn't be surprised if a President\Santorum created a Morality Police.I believe the majority of Americans are moderate and what this country needs is a moderate. I am so tired of us swinging from extreme left to extreme right and back again.

TrainSen	0	Mr Cagape, the things you've listed are true but only the tip of an iceberg.I've been in Hong Kong for two years now, and the longer I stay here, the more I hate this place. It's horribly crowded, which leads to plenty of rude people and deathly polluted air. It's ridiculously expensive, and even so, the nicer (and expensive) restaurants are always booked out and the services are shit. It's superficial; if you are or want to be a nice person, you will always get taken advantage of, unless you dress in such a way that says "I'm rich" on your forehead. \Even if you are rich, like some of the Chinese mainlanders that rush into the city for a weekend shopping spree, you will still get treated like shit. I don't get why people love Hong Kong so much. It may look civil on the outside, but on the inside, it's rotten to the core. It's just capitalism, you may say, but I don't see it in the US, and I don't even see it in China mainland (which contrary to what they argue, is very much capitalist). \Living here doesn't make me rich, it makes me pull OT everyday, put up with selfish rude people everywhere, and pay ridiculously high rent for a tiny apartment every month. If I live here for another two years, I will become so bitter that I might just fit in.

TrainSen	0	Its going to be difficult to lose weight in 7 days. Honestly, most of the weight that you'll lose is going to be water and maybe a little bit of muscle and fat if you are very careful with your calories. You can also be certain that you'll gain it back again once you get of the diet. I'd recommend that to take it slow and easy so you can see the long-term benefits. I've personally lost 180lbs since Dec 2009. My blood pressure was 160/110, now its 120/80. My cholesterol was 256 mg/dL, now its 176mg/dL. I'm no longer Pre-Diabetic and I'm in the best shape of my life. It wasn't easy but I can say that everyone can do it if they have the right program.

You live in a faulty generation caught up in personal transference of wrongdoing by the general public focused on lack of commitment to themselves, family, and country!

TrainSen	0	@hockeybellehe is so wrecked physically right now. THere's definitely something wrong with him. You can't really use the "lazy" excuse anymore because he was pretty great for most of the playoffs
TrainSen	1	We'll leave the fanaticism to morons like you, criminal.
TrainSen	1	Can we have your address so that when you die we can all come and pay our respects, and then urinate into your urn before they flush it?

TrainSen	0	That takes more strength than the father in the story would ever know. Much respect to you.
TrainSen	0	...he should be punished in some way obiously, just because he's in the SAS shouldn't make him untouchable!! unquote He has been punished plus he will get done by the army...in the Forces you get done twice...once by the civil courts then by military justice (if I may use those terms together as you are guilty until proven even more guilty!)
TrainSen	0	dcjohn: have you heard some of the white folks down in good "ole" louisiana speak? if you turn your backs you can not tell one from the other. it has to do with location and where you are born mostly. come to my state also, some of sound like our friends from the "hills". there is no such thing about being ignorant or uneducated just because you have an unusual accent.blacks speak in all languages depending on where they are from; from the Queen's english to french, or gullah, or islander or spanish. blacks are very adaptible where as other groups are a "closed knit bunch".

TrainSen	0	They have historically been completed unable to get the REAL THREAT off the road so they're going to pick some very low hanging fruit here. Inept lawmakers. Inept politicians. And sheeple for police who are going to LOVE "enforcing" this new law. They can't enforce the laws we have now that matter, so I guess they need some new ones.
TrainSen	0	My little brother and his friend are running around, making fart noises, and quoting The Lorax. I have no fucking clue what is going on.
TrainSen	0	be careful picking it up. For that price it could easily be an Admiral Ackbar.
TrainSen	0	I guess their coverage was IDIOTIC to YOU, especially when they were all but anointing your boy as the champion after day one of the Open. Tht is what I dearly love about the SYCOPHANTS, they have to have it both ways...ALL THE TIME. Crawl back under your rock CRAPI.

Libero fa campagne contro le intercettazioni e poi pubblica telefonate PRIVATE ("quel testa di C \xe8 andato a Milano" diceva Crosetto del suo boss). Il DIRETTORE di Libero si \xe8 fatto un attentato da solo, o forse \xe8 stata la guardia del corpo recidiva. Pansa, Il megagiornalista, su Libero ha scritto (e mai smentito) che ENRICO BERLINGUER ha telefonato a Curzi per raccomandare la figlia, nel 1991. Da MORTO! Questo \xe8 libero. Che si prendano Freda.

While I do miss seeing James more then we are, he's making the movie so its understandable. Just think how boring it would be around here WITHOUT mike right now, I'm glad he's stepped up to help out more.

I DOUBT EVEN HUGE BLACK COCK IN YOUR FILTHY HOLE WOULD SHUT YOU UP MORON.
TrainSen	0	Ok I am sorry but why are these idiots still around. I am white and can't stand the racsit pigs. If you can't stand being around other races and cultres then get lost. If you beat people because of their color they should be shot. Now they want a stretch of road. Yeah just what someone of color needs. To go down that road and be beaten or shot because they are of a different color. I wish I can do the stuff they do and get away with it..
TrainSen	1	The comments on twitter shows that it was to embarrass Tyler. If there was not intent of that then why would you do such a stupid idiot move as this? We are all legally adults by the time we go to college (unless you are a major genious), so it's time to start thinking like one.
TrainSen	1	WHAT THE FUCK SUN!!! WHY ARE YOU NOT POSTING MY COMMENTS!!! ILL TELL YOU WHAT I WONT FUCKING BOTHER WRITING MY OPINIONS THEN!!! ILL JUST FUCKING SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ALL THESE SYSTEM ABUSING SCUM BAGS SHALL I...DECENT

It is not only a dynamic that will occur in the US but is already occurring, where people want their rights and the real culprits of the financial disasters held accountable!
TrainSen	0	Dude, calm the fuck down and stop yelling at anyone who disagrees with you.
TrainSen	0	sounds like\Venezuela...ah, the road to being a banana republic with the emperor with no clothes that his minions the media insanely keeps insisting he isn't naked...and what is up is down and what is right is wrong. "The prince of this world" (John 12:13) Is a master of false systems. \He crafts entire schools of thought that can suck us in and destroy us...He's behind false religions, false\philosophies, false doctrine, false morality, and every\system\of that that cannot lead anyone to God. \He has infiltrated governments, economies,\educationalInstitutions, and anything that has influence in this world. \The conclusion John came to is sobering. \"The whole world lies in the power of the evil one"(John 5:19).

TrainSen	0	Sorry, I hate to be one of *those* people (if they exist here. haha) but, I posted this juts a few minutes ago in the old thread and I wanted to move it over here because it's a bit mind-blowing. From her letter to Tiger Woods:"The world seems to be all up in your business, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry about that. I really am. What happens in your life, in your car and in your marriage should not be a public issue. Unfortunately, because you are a public figure, sometimes your private life does become public. I guess it comes with the territory and maybe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re used to it by now. It still must bite, though...Of course I long for you to own your mistakes, Tiger. If you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already, and I hope you are, man up to the pain you caused your wife and family. Let the hot searing anger she has for what you did change you, not harden you. It must be a hard road to walk, both for her dealing with what you have done, and for you, making sense of where to go from here when you are in the public eye the way you are. Stand behind your actions by way of fully admitting and acknowledging them to yourself. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lie to yourself or pretend they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as bad as others think or that somehow you were justified. You weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You are reaping what you sowed, Tiger. Own it. But see, whether you acknowledge all that publicly to your fans is entirely up to you. It makes no difference to me if your public apologies are detailed or not. For it is not us you need to be apologizing to. Because you are well known does not make you accountable to the public. Share only what you want, and keep the rest private. Keep it all private, if you can. But, and I speak from painful experience here, coming entirely clean does feel good. Really good... Tonight, I am praying for restoration for your marriage. Having almost lost mine, because of my own sin and pride as well as that of my husband, I now hold redemption in marriage in such high regard...But my advice, as someone who has been there? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hide it. Own it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Change your ways. Feel repentance. Apologize to your wife. Seek counseling, lots of it if you can. Let the searing pain and guilt and remorse you hopefully feel inspire in you to see yourself for what you are: A wretched sinner in need of forgiveness. You, your heart, and that of your wife and children are what matter. Focus on them, on saving your marriage, if that is what you want to do. And truly, my husband and I pray that it is what you want to do."

TrainSen	1	Soooo, what you're saying is that YOU were a bully then, and you sound like one now. With a name like "klanman", you must be a member of the KKK. After looking at your profile and reading some of your posts, you seem to be a vile, pathetic loser full of hate. \Your mother must be real proud.
TrainSen	0	It was never going to last with Ashton.I really hope she makes a full recovery, as she's beautiful, fiesty, confident & seems really likeable. You just know Bruce will be there for her every step of the way. It's sad to see her like this just because he got bored of the marriage. He married a woman who was approaching 50, so he knew how different it would be. He shouldn't have done it if he knew it wasn't to last. 
TrainSen	0	Celebrity Big Brother IS a mistake.

TrainSen	0	IN THE LIAR'S OWN WORDS: Flashback 2007: Obama attacked trying \u2018to hide behind executive privilege' CNN'S LARRY KING: 'Do you favor executive privilege or should Karl Rove and others in that like position be forced to testify before the House or Senate? OBAMA: 'Well, you know, I think we'll \u2014 we'll determine over the next several weeks how this administration responds to the very appropriate call by Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to have these individuals come in and testify. You know, there's been a tendency on the part of this administration to \u2014 to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there's something a little shaky that's taking place. And I think, you know, the administration would be best served by coming clean on this. There doesn't seem to be any national security issues involved with the U.S. attorney question. There doesn't seem to be any justification for not offering up some clear, plausible rationale for why these \u2014 these U.S. attorneys were targeted when, by all assessments, they were doing an outstanding job. I think the American people deserve to know what was going on there.'

TrainSen	0	First off, you're not a non-drinker. I am a non-drinker and I am 1000% against this law. There are idiots in this city who should have their licenses cut in half even if they don't drink at all. I have friends who are very careful drivers with clean records and no-claim insurance histories whos civil liberties are being stripped away and people like you are letting it happen. Good for you. But Redford isn't stopping here. When YOUR rights are being stripped away, you'll be changing your tune pretty much instantly.

TrainSen	0	The comments about this sad story only proves how "smart" some people are in this once great nation. Kenya is an US ally and have been for years, including during W. Bush's administration. If this "crash" was an act of terror, this would not be the first time Kenyans faced acts of terror due to their alliance with the US. Remember the US embassy terror bombings in the late 1990's? By the way Kenya is 80% Christian and the people are not starving to death, for those who somehow believe Kenyans are all terrorist trying to destroy America because Obama's father was Kenyan. Get an education before posting "smart" comments about a nation you "smart" posters obviously know nothing about. My heart goes out to the good people of Kenya during this tragic event.

Because they KNEW he was dirty filthy pedophile...yet Paterno continue to befriend him...even letting him use the locker rooms...so that...another boy could be ANAL RAPED in the locker rooms of Penn State...Ask yourself...why would Paterno even CONSIDER letting a Man (friend or not)----back on campus after accused of being a Pedophile?!?! Unless Paterno didn't care? Paterno is just as much to blame..was his stupid decision to let the man back on campus after a D.A. was investigating and continuing to investigate Sandusky up until 2005 when the D.A. went missing and is presumed DEAD (oh and his laptop and hard drive were destroyed too...can you say cover up?!!

Do you people hear the roar!?!?Our country is rushing towards the waterfall!Look at what is happening is Greece!What makes me mad is obuma may not be able to stop us from going over the falls but he could cushion the blow yet all he thinks about is getting re-elected!

TrainSen	0	Hmmm... You claim that "Iranians ...have not started a war in 200 years." Yet I clearly recall a series of seemingly never-ending wars between Iran and Iraq in the latter part of the last century, so who started those wars? Just curious.
TrainSen	0	Last I checked the constitution still said "All men are created equal", even the gay ones. \How would straight folks feel if their right to marry was taken away? \Come on. \Fair is fair and equality is equally. \\Everyone should have the same opportunities as the rest of us. Just because you don't agree with the lifestyle doesn't give anyone in a fee country the right to force that opinion on others. \We spout freedom as our most treasured of ideas yet we want to limit the freedom of some individuals. \That is what doesn't make sense. If you don't agree with gay marriage, don't be in one. \But don't restrict someone else from conducting their lives as they wish. \That kind of control is communism.

TrainSen	0	Because of biblical prophecy, which speaks of two distinct camps emerging within the Middle East in our day, we know a divorce is coming between the two.\One camp is prophesied to be led by Iran, the other to include Syria. These two are destined to play very different roles in the sequence of end-time events that lead up to Jesus Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Coming. Syria is the keystone of the pro-Iran axis. Weakening the Assad regime, to say nothing of its collapse, would be a blow to Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah.Syrian opposition chief has already pledged to cut military ties with Iran should he come to power.It is God, the God of Abraham, Issiac and Jacob who is lining up all these chess pieces, not our feckless government or the UN.

TrainSen	0	Probably one of the few good things this year is Humphries production.He has stayed at a consistent level from last year and that helps,but I don't see him as a starter in a good team.

TrainSen	0	Oh no, not Bimbo T. Baggins on the TV again. And evil Gandalf the Red-Nosed Snotzi. It is very difficult for me to watch their sneering faces. Look at the picture - they are sneering at immigrants. There is not a doubt in my mind that Sarah Moose-Muffins would carpet-bomb Mexico if she were President. Good thing we have a rule you can't be born in Hell and need an IQ of past 5 to be President. KKKKKalamity Jane for President? No way! Who wants a White House that stinks of moose droppings and offal? Plus there's the sneering.

TrainSen	0	No, but you can't just treat someone like a piece-of-shit just because you think your shit don't stink. No one is above the law, so by law you have the right to ask a person to leave your property if they are disturbing the peace or damaging property, or stealling.

I bet if the victim happened to be your most loved one your perception of an accident would be totally different especially when you know there is arrogance on the part of these motorcade free riders.

TrainSen	0	50 so promptly stated that he was going to release his album in the first week of July with or without the assistance of his label. Regardless of all the promotions and marketing and what not, he was going to release his final LP at Interscope. And he was adamant about it. That's about 3 weeks from now. In 3 weeks, artists almost ALWAYS have out at least the first two singles of an album and the tracklisting with features and production. This mother fucker still doesn't even have a fucking TITLE! An album allegedly due in 3 weeks, without a single, tracklisting, producers, album art, and a goddamn title. Fuck these videos, 50. If you really care about hip hop and your fans like you claim you do, you'd focus on your fucking album...

Despite being the only state where a referendum to repeal (same rights as marriage) domestic partnership, the outcome of this vote is uncertain. As one of the few states that already have all marriage rights granted to domestic partners, yesterday's decision could add to the basis for overturning such a referendum in federal court.

TrainSen	0	Posted at 08:45 AM ET, 06/07/2012 Obama is killing the Democratic Party By Jennifer Rubin President Obama, I have frequently argued, has been fabulous for the conservative movement. He spurred the creation of the tea party. He helped the GOP win the House majority in 2010 and make big gains in the Senate. His Obamacare has helped revive the Commerce Clause and given a boost to conservative jurisprudence. His refusal to support human rights has caused a bipartisan revulsion and reminded us that foreign policy must be girded by American values. He's sent independents running into the GOP's arms. He's forced conservatives to think hard and express eloquently principles of religious liberty, limited government, free markets and Constitutional democracy. Obama also has wreaked havoc in the the Democratic Party. He's firmly affixed the 'tax and spend' label to it after Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. He's made Clinton into a pitch man for Mitt Romney. His rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline has split the party. His refusal to adopt the Simpson-Bowles commission's recommendations has turned Democrats into reactionaries, defending the status quo on entitlements. He's alienated Jewish voters. He's re-McGovernized the party, which now stands for appeasing despotic powers, turning on allies and slashing defense spending. (Pack it up dude, your eviction notice will be delivered in November)
TrainSen	0	Yeah, rising prices and cut food stamps before you tax the rich. Now THAT'S fucking rich. What they give a family now doesn't feed them for a month and the families need to use the food banks to supplement.
TrainSen	0	Who is the real idiot, Dogtwon or me ? You have to pick one you know. Everybody can't be the stupidest person you talk to unless you talk to yourself.

So 97 % of the other primary voters are all stupid morons and you are enlightened ?

"You had some nerve to allow yourself to be brutally raped and tortured by those five grown men. You have brought shame to this family and we will do everything in our power to have you ostracized and even killed."
TrainSen	0	It's amazing to me that there are so many DUPES out there that buy into the LIES the GOP puts out.. ESPECIALLY the proposition that the "rabble" consistently manage to vote AGAINST their OWN, BEST INTERESTS so that, when THEY eventually become "billionaires" (a foregone conclusion in their fevered minds), they will THANK the GOP for 'saving' them the 'horrible responsibilities' that paying their FAIR SHARE of taxes would mandate. One less mansion.. One less yacht.. One less limousine.. That somehow, by EMPOWERING THE RICH AND THE CORPORATE INTERESTS to HOARD more of their wealth, that they might "get in" on that wealth THEMSELVES.. That VOTING for those whose PUTRID POLICIES had sent their OWN JOBS overseas, THEY somehow will "win in the end". Delusional. Pathetic.

TrainSen	1	Some of the comments I read here are so-so lame. White people just want the world to be so fair now. But over the course of their hundreds and hundreds of years of opression, death and fear it was ok. American White people hung people cut off their private parts and took pictures with their kids and family around these dead bodies singing in the wind (a truly sick mind state; your kids). They created tricks and illegal laws and rules to get ahead in America for hundreds of years; they raped and killed destorying families and now because a person makes a choice to go to all black school where a teacher ca see a black student for themselves, or gets a interview when a white doesn't its reverse racism. WHITE PEOPLE until you lived another's history stop crying and get off your high horse!
TrainSen	0	how people bring a story about a sandwich into a conversation about religion, abortion, and rape is beyond me, but that being said... HEY GOVERNMENT!!!Stay out of my kid's lunch box.If I want my kid to eat paste and looseleaf paper for lunch, that is my business. The most hilarious part is, I bet the people making the decisions of what children can and cannot eat have more rolls on their belly than the local deli has at lunchtime.If the lawmaker who proposed this, AND all the people who enforce it (including school officials) can show me 6 pack abs and their marathon finishing time (under 3 1/2 hrs only please), then maybe I'll listen to their stupid a$$es about what my child should eat. I only wish they try doing this to an attorney who loves to litigate because he/she will break that school district in attorneys fees alone...hell, maybe I'll go pro-bono and do it myself
TrainSen	1	Fact: Radical Comic Creator is written with Real Basic. You have argued against this fact. Please go to the project page on Github and see for yourself. Fact: Lunduke has now consumed $2000 worth of time, has begged for additional money for hardware, and has not delivered on his promise as of yet. Fact: You think that I am an ignorant hillbilly though you frequently insert symbols into your responses and use improper numerology when describing a number. You habitually forfeit grammar and partially form words. In addition to that, your stream of consciousness is a collection of poorly constructed sentence fragments. In short, your English sucks dick. Fact: You think that the Internet is the only place where you have freedom of speech? I'm on the Internet and I'm in America and I just said whatever the fuck I wanted to. I implore you to argue these facts directly.

Mr O handled that pretty dam good. its about respect whether u like the man or not. bill clinton joins in the negative talk about Mr O but if u havent heard him u would never know when u c them together. how about u watch the full clip of the incident. sam donaldson knows its wrong, bill o'reilly said so, & even hannity. Mr O did answer his question. tucker knows better & if immigrant munroe has a problem, go back from whence u came & free up a job 4 a real american!GROW UP! ACT LIKE ADULTS!

Afraid of black people..LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO. Anyway back to the slavery issue. We bought you and your nig*ets from other black peeps.

TrainSen	0	The "wedge Issue" isn't whether women use birth control. T\he issue is Obama's continued and frequent and deliberate abuse of the Constitution. It is one more example of his utter willingness to destroy the principles in our founding document so that he can dictate to the populace as he sees fit. \He has shown all too often that he cares not for the First Amendment, especially if anyone uses it to speak against his policies - they are attacked, branded racist, labeled as unintelligent. \He does not respect the Second Amendment (one of the best protections against both criminals and overweening government power). \He cares not for the 10th Amendment, because he excoriates the states for exercising powers delegated to them by the Constitution - that of Arizona to protect its own borders and its budget; that of Texas to draw its electoral districts; the right of states to control their own budgets on a wide range of issues. \He does not respect the 14th Amendment if it means enforcing statutes against blacks who violate them, such as the infamous Chicago voting rights case; or the directive by his Dept. of Education to colleges and universities to reduce the legal standards of proof for finding of rape and sexual assault when brought against a male, so that a man's career can be ruined on sayso even when a police investigation shows the accuser to be lying; or his Dept. of Just-Us "Guidance Memorandum" that allows colleges and universities to (wink, wink) substitute the term "critical mass" for "quotas" and throw clear law into the trashcan while pursuing racial preferences. \He does not believe in the right to contract guaranteed by Article I of the Constitution - note his "giving" labor unions position ahead of stockholders and bondholders in the grants to Chrysler and GM. \Note his efforts to curtail what companies pay their executives - a matter for stockholders who own those companies, not the government. Another issue is his apparent belief that the public is incredibly stupid. \His "compromise" on the birth control requirement for Catholic institutions simply means that the overall rates for health insurance will be raised for those institutions to pay for both the administrative costs of "outreach" as well as for the birth control devices - including abortifacients such as the "morning after" pill. \Nothing is free, but one would never know it by looking at his "budgets."

Tell us, gossip sandy, has the former husband been complaining to you and promise you his organ if you share his loss? The deceased wife of Magnanimous Mugabe complained? We have never heard anything from these people about their PRIVATE LIVES. You ever thought that the ALL had a pact? Comrades sharing their female(s). Wives not minding husbanding having a 'small house'? These are ALL fine traditional practices. Those who are gossipy and sex-obsessed are going to have a hard time with the more conservative and wise African practices, which have sustained coherent African societies for thousands of generations. Go do the gossip in Europe; they are much into minding other people's business. Dignified African females are to busy to waste time with such gossipy garbage

TrainSen	0	How A CSM Works. After a hand is over the cards just used are placed back into the shuffler to be mixed with the other cards in the shoe. Shuffle Master's King uses an elevator system to randomize the cards. As the elevator is moved up and down, cards are randomly inserted into one of the 19 shelves in the elevator. The shuffler randomly selects a shelf of cards to deliver into the shoe. Because of the non-linear process, every discard re-inserted following a hand has a chance of appearing in the next round. Although Shuffle Master says The King differs from their competitors continuous shufflers because the others use a linear design most CSMs so the same thing. They put the discards back into play and does away with the dealers having to stop to physically shuffle the cards at the end of a shoe. The House Edge The continuous shufflers have no benefits for the player and has been dubbed the "uncomfortable shoes". It eliminates card counting for the skilled player and will also have a major disadvantage for the basic strategy player. It speeds up the game! When the CSM was first introduced many players felt it would probably increase the house edge. As it turns out this is not entirely true. Michael Shackleford, The Wizard of Odds did a mathematical analysis of the Continuous Shuffling Machines and found that there was a very slight reduction in the house edge. In a four deck game the edge is 0.034 percent and in an eight deck game is tis0.014 percent. Before you get excited about a slight reduction in the house edge you have to realize that when the casino uses a CSM the speed of the games is increased by about 20 percent. The basic strategy player stands to lose more in the long run because they are exposing more money to the house edge. As a player I feel it's a treat to visit a casino that offers double and single deck games. I would hate to see these games eliminated altogether. Even a multi deck shoe game is preferable to the Continuous Shuffling Machines. The best way you can let the casinos know this is by refusing to play Blackjack at the casinos that use a CSM for their Blackjack games

TrainSen	0	I really like " When you combine tactics such as these, you have an integrated marketing and communication program that drives results. Real results such as improved margins, shortened sales cycles, and increased revenues." I've read a few friends recently trying to defend the idea of accepting PR as a $15k/month crap shoot that eventually the media would magically convert you into a success. As far as I can see, a few months in I'm going to see results that paid for thet monthly spend, or I'm going to find something else to spend it on. Magical thinking is what has jacked up huge segments of our society today.

Yea Obama tries to work with Redumblicans and hes the one whos partisan...dont make me laughhe mocks our process of democracy, praises and supports our enemies and alienates our friends.he claims to want to create jobs, then has his socialist minions squash any efforts at expansion or business starts with excessive regulations, fines, fees and lawsuits.>>>>>>>>Supports our enemies like he did Bin Laden who Bush gave a pass too for what 8 yrs...this whole post here is laughable on its idiotic face...Again...Im not gonna entertain this notion of bile you just posted cause its too comical to address...stop watching Fix news...in case you didnt know they dont tell the TRUTH...they just propagnadize...BTW>..who are Obamas socialist minions...you mean Saul Alinsky or Bill Ayers...what about Josef Stalin...while youre at it... a truth socialist would laugh in your face listening to you squawkI could write pages, but the effort would be wasted.>>>>dont waste the informed voters time and effortI see from your profile you're something of an amateur at this, it would be helpful to your case if you could post some links verifying your claims.>>>>>>>>Is that the best you can do is insult people based on their AVI??/ you sound like a child thrashing around in the sandbox at schoolHave you considered a career selling fertilizer? >>>>>Maybe you should try it first and show us hows its done and honestly anyone that cosigns on that partisan parrot bile is just as big an idiot...I didnt see one fact in that while Diabtribe
TrainSen	0	Who are any of us to say who is or is not trustworthy to hold nuclear weapons? Especially Israel, or more precisely, apologists for it like yourself?
TrainSen	1	god, you really are stupid.
TrainSen	0	you talk crap. Nothing shooting does "endangers many species of birds and animals" but you are welcome to now give us examples of this. So go on, name some animals and birds endangered by shooting.
TrainSen	1	you're so FUCKING DUMB!
TrainSen	0	*replying here to save space* I think I understand what you're feeling. Put it this way, as someone who is actively involved in the systematic elimination of other human beings, I totally understand how all this movie shit really aint that important in the grand scheme of things. However, I and others in a similar situation use them to decompress from that real shit, and more often than not movies help express stuff in ways only film can. It does have value. And to your hypothetical situation about the victim using faith to survive, I would recount the <i>very real</i> examples of young afghan girls getting their faces mutilated by their own family over irrational outdated customs/religious beliefs. Is it better to have faith that produces these atrocites. I don't know, I dont have an answer. Alls I know is although I thoroughly disagree with the absolute abolition of religion, its very obvious that we have to find a way to evolve our thought processes. Oh, and as far as movie related articles are concerned, Scientology is famously a very big force in the entertainment industry, as many of the big name A-list actors follow that faith. I think it warrants discussion. And don't forget, theres a movie coming out later this year about the Hubbard, the trailer for which was covered recently here. Worth checking out.

Before putting your 2 sense into something that you have no education on, just what you hear from the Media, think about what you say. You sound like a fucking pawn just like the rest of society, believe everything you see on the news, you brainwashed grunt.

TrainSen	1	Stop whining you moron democrats you backed aFucking no brain marxist loser in 2007. Now pay the price
TrainSen	0	This is actually a dumb idea. So you switch one union for another and then what? What about all other state unions? What about CCPOA or CAHP and all others? Apparently you do not have a clue that it is the bargaining system, not specific unions that skrew the employees.All it takes is for one or two of any of these unions make a deal that will be enforced on all employees. Are you going to decertify all of them? You are very naive and want someone else to collect the dues.
TrainSen	1	I already have insurance you jack AZZ. But If I didn't I will show up where I want to for medical care and you dumb AZZ will be paying for it just like you will be for all of those that can't and or won't afford to get insurance. See, this is why I don't like talking to people like you, you have to use nasty language on you opposition because that's the way you deal with people that do not agree with you.
TrainSen	0	And of course we have the added benefit of the poor 19yo who will now forever drive like an old lady for fear of hitting somebody else. On behalf of all drivers who will get stuck behind the slowpoke in future i would like to say to the girls - Fuck You Very Much.
TrainSen	0	First of all its the SCOTUS moron, and secondly the ruling by the 9th is written for Kennedy bro, have you read it? It mirrors Romer v. Evans, I wouldn't be so sure about your slap down, we only need one vote from theSupremes and judging by their rulings on gay rights and equal protection in the past, Perry v. Brown is a slam dunkfor our side.
TrainSen	0	Whyte brings to mind a sleezy, greasy second hand car saleman in the act of conning some poor old dear out of her money. Where are all the "in Whyte we trust" comments now, slowly but surely the followers of rangers are awakening to the destinct demise of their team...R.I.P.

TrainSen	0	And now parents are afraid AFRAID to let their kids play outside. I used to ride my bike all over Stockton (before it came the Stockton it is today) and climb tress and play cowboys and indians (where someone dramatically died every six seconds). Of course, more people went to church then and there was spanking in schools and there was just a lot more respect for the institutions that made this country great. So sure, let's sue Hollywood, but then let's sue the liberals that made the Democratic party the moral wasteland it is today.

TrainSen	0	Yay, IGN! (not sarcastic) You've echoed the complaints of many forum users, including myself: that Inferno is too hard for normal people and blandly straightforward for AH junkies. But Blizzard has indicated they plan to patch this, so I'm not too worried.

TrainSen	1	Hey moron, 1) you're a disgusting human 2) Seau wasnt on those pats teams. You're a fool.
TrainSen	0	Mcfloyd, your simple assertions don't hold up to scrutiny. Did Bush live within his means? Did he fully reveal the costs of two simultaneous wars, Energy Policy made behind closed doors and led by Dick Cheyney, or the costs of the Big Pharma Drug Benefit giveaway? Did President Obama inherit a budget surplus or budget deficit? How many jobs were we losing before the President took office? When you come back with those answers, perhaps I'll give your inane little quips some consideration.
TrainSen	1	BS. Lowe you are an arrogant prick. Beyond criticism? You deserve nothing but criticism you idiot.
TrainSen	1	Can you post a statement without using the word idiot? Try being a little more eloquent with your retorts or just start pulling the wings off of flies towhile the hours away...

TrainSen	0	I double-taked (took?) at that. Malaise? MALAISE? "Hating shit because puberty" is not malaise, goddammit. Teen malaise, give me a fucking break. On the other hand, I can at least be drinking at work right now, I understand school-bound teenagers are not as lucky.

TrainSen	1	You two are fucking trolls. What a sickening thought. Last time I checked Oaxaca is relatively safe, but ya'll wouldn't know that cause both of you have your heads up your ass. Btw, most of the violence is on the borderstates of Mexico. Or did you forget that, too?
TrainSen	0	well worded. "was not proud at the time" meaning they are now because they\feel the world owes them a thank you for killing\civilians and "saving" more?\shouldnt we thank those who lost their lives to help "save" more people? you make me sick. and this is for the bird\giving you words of wisdom. it's great that you understand the logic and ironically point out\"will bend facts and contort causality" when it comes to debates. you forgot to point out using facts\out of context. now please go educate the rest of your friends and find a giant mirror to stare into. \

TrainSen	1	Well then the OP would learn that she cannot diagnose herself with Aspergers, and that self-diagnosis is a bad thing leading to people whom act stupidly because they think they have some disorder/diseasethat in actuality, they don't.
TrainSen	0	You just went full retard. Never go full retard.
TrainSen	0	Somehow, I feel that Pakistan is right in the middle of all of this garbage. Yet, the United States keeps supplying them with arms and money. No sense to this at all.
TrainSen	1	You act like you faced a good team. You played like crap against another crappy team.
TrainSen	0	He still played. he didn't say that much. And obviously the Heat reserves are going to lose that either way. It is when Lebron and Wade are playing this post season that the celtics need to worry.

TrainSen	0	eish Wenger did a stupid mistake but he will never admit it anyway...it was good for us that the Ox was taken off and we were going to lose that match but Wenger did a brilliant Sub...Good luck guys for your 4th spot.
TrainSen	0	We were thinking back in time when a young GHWB was goaded by his ambitious young wife to eliminate JFK., it would go something like this,Babs, I can't stand that JFK, get rid of that white trash. Then a little while later Babs said I can't stand that MM she's gonna run her mouth and then, RK is finished. Now that would be a much better HBO movie...the white-washed Bush Legacy is getting tough to swallow.
TrainSen	0	are you talking about the conservatives that cheered the idea of letting a man d ie if he didnt have insurance? or the conservatives that booed a gay soldier currently deployed.
TrainSen	0	im sorry but dont nobody just pick somebody out randomly and start attacking...like she went ham for a reason. kimora seem like one of those low-key stank bitches. it might not be all true but kimora played a role. aint no black chick just just gon go off like that.

TrainSen	0	Oh god, that is one hilarious video. It is the one with the Professor Layton rapist dude, right? XD I didn't click it, but I've seen it before. So funny. ^_^ (No matter how odd that sounds.)
TrainSen	1	Wait you said though that your country was the nice one in the world- how bout you take that food from your dog and help feed the population of the world because i thought america was great right, they always try to use theor ethics- apparently not because losers like you are selfish andignorant
TrainSen	0	Gosh, Peggy Hill ... Don't make me laugh.In addition to money ... Romney won because Newt is bombastic and is a serious liability in the general ... all the polls show it and intelligent conservatives feel it ... this is about style not substance.Both will do the same thing in office just with entirely different styles.Newt ruffles feathers all day long drawing stark contrasts even when it means lying or exagerrating ... like calling Mitt anti-immigrant on national TV ... unbelievable.And since Peggy Hill knows far less about national politics than I do since I have studied it for 25 years, I'm not inclined to be persuaded by her.She describes the political scene like I used to 15 years ago ... with little to no expertise, so I don't pay her a lot of attention when we disagree. Peggy Hill is a Great American and I love her and Newt dearly but this is not the time to vote with my heart ... way too much at stake!Newt is the world's best field general but his\temper and tone are wearing me out and I'm conservative ... I can only imagine how offended Independents are beginning to feel. Sure it helped that Mitt raised more money ... that is essential in beating Dingle Barry ... Peggy Hill sounds like an OWS'er ranting that Mitt had more money ... thank God he did ... that's what it's all about! So you Newt zombies really ought to do the Hokey Pokey and turn yourselves around, lol. If Newt will fold under lies and carpet bombing ... as he said he would ... then he's got zero chance of beating Owebamao ... think about it ... that's all Barry does. I don't care too much that Mitt is uninspiring ... I know he can beat Owebamao and I know he will attract Independents and Latinos in 2014... particularly with a Romney/Rubio ticket.My first choice for POTUS is a Christy/Rubio ticket ... neither are running but both back Romney. By the time Super Tuesday rolls around, Mitt will prolly already be the clear front runner but I never count Newt out. But for Peggy Hill to be upset Mitt raised and outspent Newt is laughable ... that's what you're supposed to do! BTW - Remember the Sirens??? Beautiful half-woman, half-bird-like Newt creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot everything including their own safety. The Sirens are Newtish sisters who lure sailors to their death. The sonsg of the Sirens are irresistible but they reside beyond unsurpassable reefs which destroy the sailors' boat when they try to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast ... just sayin'.

TrainSen	0	Dude red on my iPod it says it will be 98* out today
TrainSen	0	Yes, but very few structures have actually burned in this fire. The issue is the forest itself. We're talking millions of acres of dry forest in an area so mountainous that a very high percentage of the land is not accessible to vehicles. This is part of what would be a normal natrual cycle, if it weren't for beetle-kill trees and below average (and the average is minimal) precipitation. In the meantime, we've got smoke over a major city with flames approaching. Plus, this is watershed of the South Platte, the most heavily worked river in the state, and fire-damaged areas wreak havic on water quality and precipitate flash floods.

TrainSen	0	Nope..your maths!..its 159 played with 16 draws., and Glenwood can be thankfull for the draw. Maritzburg College where the better team on the field on the day.
TrainSen	0	@aarongmyers to be honest the translation of Ender's Game isn't great... much like the first book in the HP series, which is why I have been avoiding the challenge in Chinese for so long. But I agree about finding something fun to read. The key is being able to provide yourself with the ability to have comprehensible input while you are reading. Going to the dictionary for every other word and still not understanding what you are reading is one of the most painful things to deal with as a language learner.
TrainSen	0	yeah well director interpretation isn't always the best insight for things like this, especially with something with such a rabid fan base. On top of that i think they are condensing more than i would have liked...even if the golden age was kinda meh in comparison to the drama going on now, i would have at least liked for them to show them doing their thing on the battle field.

TrainSen	0	From what I can see, most men like women who are physically fit. You don't have to look like a runway model, but YOU DO need to look like you take care of yourself, eat reasonably well, and exercise. Studies have shown (though I'm referencing information I read YEARS ago) that WM actually prefer a larger body type than WW, but not as large as BM or HM. WW seem to want to be a size zero, while WM seem to like the athletic Swedish model body. Anyway, I think both of the ladies above look very attractive. However, I don't understand this fixation on having butts and thighs that are WAY out of proportion with the rest of one's figure. That isn't attractive to me, personally. I just don't get it. And, seeing a HUGE rear on a small girl just doesn't make any sense. I don't know how it's physically possible to have skinny arms, legs, waist, and still have a humongous derriere and/or thighs. Many men like a nice-sized butt, including WM and AM (I know from experience), so a BW's full, round bottom isn't necessarily a problem for men in general. But, MOST men (including BM) don't want a bottom that's so obese it looks like it's own planet. Get and stay in shape for your own health and opportunities, BW.

TrainSen	1	Listen you fucking wanker -- we approve all comments, so long as they are not inflammatory against a type of people. We censor blatant bigotry. But little dickwrinkles like you calling me a pussy? I'd never censor that. Look at other posts...people have wished AIDS on me dude, so...I've heard worse fuckhead.That said, if you have to sleep with a woman in her 60s, then that's pretty sad, dude. Try dating girls your own age. It's kind of weird you're into way older chicks. You might wanna rethink hugging your own mom when you have a boner going forward.Plus, I have had more ass than every male in your entire family line -- with their fucked up teeth and small dicks -- has ever seen. Just a point of clarification, you bucket of cunt slop.

TrainSen	1	If you claim you don't have the power to forgive but only "Allah", why then do you arrogate yourself the power to avenge? Are you not double-speaking? Why not leave both powers to the owner, "Allah" and allow him to fight for himself? Or is he not capable? We are not afraid of you; we are not afraid of death. Everyone will eventually die, both the killer and the killed; our Lord Jesus long time ago warned us about sects like yours and encouraged us not to be afraid for you can only kill the body but can do no further harm after that: you can't kill our souls which ultimately goes back to our God; so kill all you can, Jesus will forever remain Lord!

TrainSen	0	@SRQDawgs15 @TheLadySportswriter Some of the opponents scoring were Touchdowns that Murray threw to their Defensive backs or we gave the opponents really short fields. I am not saying UGA doesn't have great talent on both sides of the ball. However, the consistency on offense is missing. The short dump-off passes are missing. And, obviously our running game and O-Line play were missing. However, the boneheaded CT runs up the middle, the flat footed draw plays, and the fumbles at critical times by Murray and the pick 6's had to demoralize our young defense. Personally, I would like to see us never get behind in a game and to win every game by 3 touchdowns. Please forgive me if I am asking too much.
TrainSen	1	what's your deal bro? You aren't concerned, and you damn sure are not a liberal. Why don't you just be yourself instead of coming on posing as a screwed up exaggeration of people you don't like or understand? Did your mommy not love you enough or something?
TrainSen	0	"obviously clean", you are in denial
TrainSen	0	I bet the songs on the upcoming CD were written for This twit. The message was she is a progressive. She knows where herbread is buttered. I have never even heard of her. I bet if she had to write her own material. Ms Hoe would be a major disappointment to her idiotic fans. What was her message with the exorcism? CBS management look like total knuckleheads. No wonder their ratings suck. Bring back garage bands. They play instruments, write their own material & perform to their fans. Most of the music truly sucks today. Record executives don't even try to find pure raw talent.. It seems they try to clone their stars. Visual imagery for shock value\over solid Rock-n-Roll. 
TrainSen	0	Just a thought. About those unwinnable, illegal wars. If they were illegal wouldn't you think Bush and Cheney would have charges brought up on them by now? Fact is they were on the level its just another example of the liberal media getting alll you liberals wound up tighter than Dick's hatband. Just like little wind up toys, get you started and away you go! It's time to start thinking about Impeachment of the Dope Head in Chief.
TrainSen	0	Define abortion in objective terms. Explain the whole process of abortions too me. Explain what you see in a sonogram of a baby with fingers, toes, fingerprints, eyes, a heartbeat and brainwaves. Explain late term abortions for me. Where they pull a baby's head out and inject it with saline and then vacuum their brains out. Pro choicers are cowards at the core. How brave of you to lay down your responsibilities for what you did at a nightclub getting drunk and having unprotected sex and then kill your living mistake.

I never would have even called a Representative in this case. A 'school health inspector' would have had their ass handed to them and then the school principle, too. For even HAVING such a useless position in the first place. Who has time to inspect kids' lunches and who has $$ to pay a person to do that at ANY school???

Calm down no need to point out what he has done so far we all know lets talk about how to get him back to where he was so we are getting out of him what we all expected.. this team is going to the playoffs regardless of his performance it would just be nice if he contributed like he should be and i fully expect that he will pay dividends sooner rather than later

The liberal version of a "tax cut" is when tax payers are allowed to keep some more of their hard earned money. NEWS FLASH to Liberals: IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY.

I can't fault them for loving their child that much. On the other hand, there are some people that will just believe anything a celebrity says, just because that person is a celebrity.

You took that gun with you on purpose, and you darn sure got to use it, as you intended." A little harsh, aren't you. Nothing like piling on when the guy on the bottom, who admittedly made a huge mistake, is already feeling terrible about it. You are in no position to judge him...perhaps you should try walking in his shoes. His life has been changed forever. And I doubt he premeditated to kill his brother. That's not how accidents happen. Was he careless? Yes. But I doubt he's a murderer.

TrainSen	1	Rob, you have proven your point already. We understood - you are an antisemit. You can relax now.
TrainSen	0	Faux is a better source of animus.
TrainSen	1	It is a great honor to be a Zionist. You are garbage, a retarded idiot.
TrainSen	0	Sorry, but that's just a dumb statement. You're comparing some 3rd party promo to apple's own functionality. For example, if this were a reference to a carrier removing google navigation and forcing customers to use telenav, you'd have a valid argument. But not in this case. If you want to make odd comparisons let's talk about how the iPhone fucked everyone on sprint who enjoyed 1yr contracts, longer return periods and other perks that got taken away all because of the iPhone. See, that's why I like Android, because they don't make the carrier take one up the ass and screw their users out of perks they've enjoyed for years.
TrainSen	1	sgboy,get back to your cot,I hear your parents calling for you.
TrainSen	0	@PeevedMichelle Um, good question. Please email polly@blogher.com
TrainSen	0	Looks like you have a Stormer problem!..The same team that beat the bulls TWICE...Habs and Jean were great...Morne, Spiesand Hougaard was below par...Crusty the clown dont belong in this company.
TrainSen	0	Joey Barton only has a twitter account because he wants people to massage his ego. 
TrainSen	1	You are a pig.
TrainSen	0	Got your back, here, r_dale. Good post. Typical of the gun nuts in Utah.
TrainSen	0	His wrist might be bothering him. He's got a chip floating around in there.
TrainSen	0	Based on the architecture, stucco building and foliage...oh, and the dancing gay black kid, I'm betting this is from Florida.
TrainSen	1	fly away gay_pusssy...fly away.
TrainSen	1	We're not the losers but you and this country are.
TrainSen	0	YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY. What's wrong with a man looking at a woman with a beautiful body ESPECIALLY NICE HIPS? If I'm stalker for that then every dude I know is a stalker as well.
TrainSen	0	Looks like a case of "Cat on Keyboard Disease".
TrainSen	0	Go get them Egyptians.Kill them all!We will be right behind you.\hahahahehehe (Genesis 16:12) \He will be a wild ass [uncivilized] of a man (Yismael and his descendants) . His hand [will be] against everyone (meaning a robber per Rashi) and everyone's hand will be against him (meaning everyone will hate him and will attack him per Rashi); and in the presence of all his brothers he will dwell (meaning: his descendants will be many per Rashi).
TrainSen	1	Commenter? Your very childish. Grow up and be a man. Stupid remarks like yours just proves that you are a little boy and have yet to understand what it means to be an adult.
TrainSen	0	Awesome font and color on your card:)
TrainSen	0	Not tonight tv844..chill with that. The Brewer and Dodger fans are just enjoying the game wherever they are hoping that their team wins. Simple ain't it?

TrainSen	0	\Yes, God gave us free will.No matter what the sin is, sin is a choice. People weren't born gay.Somewhere in their environment or upbringing, they chose that lifestyle.There are people who enter it and leave it every day.
TrainSen	0	I don't go to the woods this time of year, to hot, too many chiggers. I stick to shore until it cools off!
TrainSen	0	gloves on the baby please
TrainSen	0	Why don't you think he'll be worth it?
TrainSen	0	There's far worse things happening in Africa,and where's your humanity towards africa.More than half of Mali has been taken over by FSA best mates Al Quaida,Mauritania still has a slavery system going on,Chad,Niger,Darfur,South Sudan are on the brink of famine,Somalia once again FSA best mates Al Quaida ruining the country,north eastern congo there's deaths and mass rapes,don't you reckon some of the issues in Africa are far worse than syrian regime battling terrorists.
TrainSen	0	You are 100% spot on in regards to that little brat.
TrainSen	1	Seems like you are on tik you moron! Are all people of your colour rapists of mothers and children? I don't think so. Stop making idiot comments!
TrainSen	1	You certainly come off as an arrogant s.o.b. Your right ends when the safety of others begins. I don't give a rat's arse THAT you hunt, but keep your bullets along with your second hand smoke away from me. Sheffield Village is a sprawling area and you are living in the past. YOU, sir, may have to find a new piece of hunting paradise to fulfill your desires. As far as history goes, tyhe Indians hunted all over. Places change. Get with it or get out!
TrainSen	0	The existence of the interstate highway system hardly outweighs the vast amount of other problems with the federal government. I hear a lot of "you can thank bush and cheney" from you but what has your precious obama done to reverse any of that? Oh, do I hear the letters 'ndaa'? I think I do. obama is as much a globalist stooge as those two are. The borders are indeed open and if the federal government could accomplish it politically (and they will not stop trying) they indeed would not be illegal aliens. You think you are being funny about the violent savages comment but what good will come of importing masses of somalians, mexicans, muslims, and haitians do us? These people as a general rule are violent and backwards. I see no need for the existence of MS-13 in our nation. You seem to think that I support bush, cheney, or romney. Nothing could be further from the truth. These "people" are all globalist zionist scum like your much favored obama. Why is it that it is so hard to see what is right in front of your face? obama is a sellout to the transnational elites just like bush is. Their intention is to destroy us and you seem to have your head in the sand.
TrainSen	0	Thats what I thought about Herge, but turned out he was just opinionated as fuck. Turn the other cheek.
TrainSen	1	WhatIsBannedIsNeverSuppressed, you're just a sorry ass commie aren't you? Too lazy to get out of bed to better yourself. Much easier to sit back and let others do the hard graft and hand over money to you to live your commie dream. Never mind thinking big, try working big. That's what benefits all. Your type make me sick to my core.
TrainSen	1	How stupid are you? Do you realize that many women take birth control pills for many reasons besides preventing pregnancy? Educate yourself,fool.
TrainSen	1	fucking idiots
TrainSen	0	Durant needs to do something fine a way to get him free.
TrainSen	0	Laird ans Avila (and Santos) may be among the Tigers' most marketable players- at least as far as trading for a starting pitcher or a starting 2B is concerned.
TrainSen	1	you're a fighter not a lover,and your family needs to die too.
TrainSen	0	@beatles4life but TNA is full of 'retired wrestlers'? So shouldn't that be 'has been wrestling' too?
TrainSen	0	Where do you find time to record an album when you're on trial for murder?
TrainSen	0	\\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt puts politics between women and their healthcare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What do THEY think they are doing? Both sides are putting politics between Americans and their liberty.As an aside, the only reson the left wants people to have all the abortions they want is because they want to control who can and can't have children. They want to create the "master race" themselves.Women's rights?Sure, like they actually care. If they did, we'd have occupied the middle east a long time ago in the name of saving women from rape, mutilation, and murder!
TrainSen	0	I love a coach that can talk naughty.
TrainSen	1	Ok. You are a complete retard. Re-read what you just said about a "bullpen". You know nothing about baseball!
TrainSen	0	Tampa is loosing also. They may give us yet ANOTHER break!
TrainSen	0	to be honest, dont you think that some fool made this fake twittwer account up ?
TrainSen	0	THERE IS NO WAY ROGER MAYWHEATHER SAID THESE THINGS. HIS ACCOUNT WAS DEFINETELY HACKED INTO. NO MAN OF HIS POSITION WILL SAY THESE KIND OF THINGS. I MEAN, HE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE IN THAT WAY.
TrainSen	0	Is this a defensive stand for Theo or an offensive jab at paolo? They really aren't the same thing. If you've been reading him THAT long and dislike him THAT much then ignore his comments. The irony is , many of paolo's views and opinions bring the GOOD Cub Fan out of many of us .( rahrah) The guy was a Military Drill Instructor devoted to creating fearless fighters. He just does it on a different scale now creating fearless fans out of fair weather fans. Just Sayin man.
TrainSen	0	No, they choose to be gay for the same reason Jerry Sandusky chooses to F boys in the rear...it's deviance, and I agree, once they are caught up in it, it's nearly impossible to stop. But it IS a choice.\

TrainSen	1	That is a moronic response. They should not repeat the crimes they commited? Please don t post your trash here.
TrainSen	0	Please use your search engine before you look any dumber. or just go straight to the police information so far. . .
TrainSen	1	By "your kind" I mean angry little Yankee know-it-alls,who are complete white trash in the states they came from and move here and think they know everything, because "Southerners are slow and backwards". You were trash up there and you are trash down here. Go home and take all of your friends with you. You are ruining our culture and quality of life. Although, you Sir wouldn't understand anything about quality of life,you are a pathetic internet troll who's entire life is sadly based around your pathetic rants on message boards. Go Home dude.
TrainSen	0	The fucking website said it worked for A4 devices only; now I'm in 5.1.1, don't have 5.01 shsh blobs (just learned about those), ifaith doesn't recognize my ios, and I have two different redsn0w versions that now don't mean shit.

TrainSen	0	Providing oil companies with $4 billion to offset their costs for exploration is socialism, is it not? That little gift did not come from Obama, it came from Bush.
TrainSen	1	And you need to know classified information because... When it passes into history, there is little anyone can do about it. And in the meantime, you really don't need that information. I'm guessing you just want to feel smug about getting it.
TrainSen	0	Crap, your ChicK as got a run.

TrainSen	0	Obama is working as fast as he can.

TrainSen	0	Is that why your head smells like Obamas-ass?
TrainSen	0	Exactly. McCain is not sexist. He is also responsible for that complete fucking imbecile Joe the Plumber.
TrainSen	0	That's the difference. They can't just make a run and think they can win against the Spur's. They have to be able to make stops when it counts. Young team, bright future.
TrainSen	1	LOL!!!! Do you even realize you are making a fool of yourself? I bet next you will post something Like "I forwarded your post to the FBI" or maybe " I told my mommy" Speaking of growing up Get busy.\
TrainSen	0	this is getting very silly...headline MY RACE HELL...a tad dramatic...
TrainSen	0	awww you go back checking your posts for likes. how sad.
TrainSen	1	You stupid f uuu c k. I hope you die the same way she did.
TrainSen	1	But, you couldn't show ANY proof of that, even if it was true. Go away. You are an embarassment to your Klan brothers, your family, your neighbors, your teachers and America as a whole. Find something to say that is not directly quoting Nazi or Stalinist propaganda. The most pathetic poster on the web. You are below Oberbite, a Soros trool or the ignorant little heap that wwrote "Waiting to Exhale".
TrainSen	0	Many ppl report seeing an officer pounding away at his chest while screaming breathe you mofo.

TrainSen	0	For those of you who do not know this, check out the Dep. of Ag.The food stamp program comes out of the Dep. of Ag. budget. For those of us who are farmers, we would like that explained to all and we would also like the US government to get out of our business with their "cheap food policy". The regulations and demands made on farmers by the USDA, EPA, IRS, NSC, etc. would blow your minds.And don't forget PETA! Enjoy every bite of food that you take, unless of course it is NOT grown in this country - farmers in other parts of the world do NOT have to abide by the same rules we do. I have no problem cutting the budget - any business that wants to stay in operation has to be lean to prosper.

TrainSen	1	Are you fucking dumb? "making it clear that the group was delaying their comeback due to album production and not toavoid competition with other groups." You should be thankful that 2ne1 didn't cameback this june, if 2ne1 did, those awards will be owned by 2ne1. Fuckin insicured fx fan.

TrainSen	0	Obama's econimic plan BS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TrainSen	1	You are an IDIOT!!!
TrainSen	0	How is it reasonable, Anon, when Harper has done none of the things you attribute to Fascism? All-powerful leader? Has to stand for re-election in three years. Strict social order? You're joking, right? Glorification of militarism? The troops have been recalled and their budget trimmed. Opposition parties? Hale and hearty and full of piss and vinegar. Elimination of organized labour? No, they did that to themselves by pricing themselves out of the market. Advancement of business over individuals? Elaborate. Ethno-centrism? Try Qu\xe9bec, Thomas Mulcair's home ground. Disparagement of the Constitution? That's the SCC's specialty. Belittling the courts? Who doesn't, these days, and for good reason. Dissolution of MP power? Do you see the House of Commons burning (along with those crosses in Prince George)? Spying on ordinary citizens? Child pornographers are not ordinary citizens. Judging by the raving of Harper's enemies on these blogs, if he wins another majority, there's going to be a worldwide tinfoil shortage.
TrainSen	1	Well, I WAS born and raised in Africa and proud of it! Wth do you think Africans are lesser than you or something?? Take your ignorant ass somewhere else cuz I'm not the one.
TrainSen	0	See, I was actually reading your comment, until I got to the comment, "but I completely backed Herman Cain before he backed out because of the scandal." Then I realized, you know nothing about politics. Do some research. Then come back and make an educated comment.
TrainSen	0	So you think Cigar Willie Clinton will help obongo win? Balack Obongo has learned his lesson too late. You cant trust a fuckingliberal. Just like you cant trust a liberal troll commenter.

TrainSen	0	When you could not reveal the names given of foreign a/c holders, you are nothing but an another piece of crap like PM, chidu, deshmukh, salman etc; you all lost the confidence of public because of lies after lies. History will never forgive you guys.
TrainSen	0	When that nigga tighten his belt I knew he couldnt fucked up... He look like WANDA
TrainSen	0	That's what the "Full Comment" banner at the top is for... but you are right, the front page links to opinion pieces without indicating them as such.

TrainSen	0	I guess you are those who have a fetish for huge silicon boobs.
TrainSen	0	pretty much the same thing happensto most of the animals in factory farms. This keychain business is horrible, but remember so are battery chicken farms, dairy farms and so on. know how food and clothes and everything you use is produced. Often there are animals that suffer to produce those things. utilize the internet, know the truths! It will change your diet and the way you live :-)
TrainSen	0	You would know a thing or two about having trains ran on yourself sending messages from theo lacy...
TrainSen	0	I'm assuming he has a mustache as well as the headphones and ipod case? It probably would have been more relevent to mention that.
TrainSen	0	He was almost hit in the head by the previous pitch. He was a little out of place after that pitch. Imagine getting a curveball towards the head (missing you) and then on the next pitch is a 94 mph fastball down the middle. No way your reaction will be to swing.
TrainSen	1	try speaking in correct english as well. what dummies are on here today.
TrainSen	0	Nothing has been proven at all. Just like all those birther lawsuits. There is NO proof. Just because a bunch of gullible people believe it doesn't make it true.
TrainSen	0	You clearly don't know him.
TrainSen	1	Who the hell do you think you are saying anything! SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE THE UNEDUCATED IGNORANT PIECES OF SHIT TO ME!!!!
TrainSen	1	Answer: Yes. No. Yes. Are you retarded? Meh. Nope.
TrainSen	0	what kills me is if you disagree with me that you are a racist.
TrainSen	1	You don't wear your brain bucket ...you only hurt you and your family. You become impaired you have the ability to hurt everyone.
TrainSen	0	He's not an Isolationist. He just does not want a foreign policy that ends in America stomping all over the world like Babylonians. Only RON PAUL will defend Israel when they blow up Iran's nuclear sitesjust like only RON PAUL defended Israel when they blew up Iraq's nuclear sites. Ron Paul is hardly an isolationist, he just recognizes a lot of tough truths about America's foreign policy that the self-righteous warmongers just can't seem to swallow. 
TrainSen	0	Oh Pops you must really really be enamoured with Bill you naughty boy you
TrainSen	0	We could start a media blitz like they did with the drug campaign. You know, the one . . . "this is your brain, this is . . .". We could show pictures of Pelosi and say . . . this is your bomb vest . . . here's your reward when you blow yourself up.
TrainSen	1	Nice use of vulgarity attached to a teen; you have real internet muscles. Nice racist screen name too, if a male you fit the bill as a female nick-name. Disgusting; no way that you are a patriotic conservative.
TrainSen	0	Child fails to pull plug out of the wall as its glued in!Child fails to push chair to counter as there is an adult in the room!

There are also no hanging leads,blind pulls etc in any of the family rooms That way I don't have to beat my children (and yes I do count a smack) Using your logic I should come and beat you until you learn how to take simple safety precautions and remember that life is about managing risk not removing it as thats impossible.

TrainSen	0	He's never looked into McKenna's spending spree. Such as the shiny new storefrontoffices the AG rents at exorbitant rates from buddy Putnam in Tacoma. This has nothing to do with republican/democrat. It's all about buddies having each other's back and making well for themselves - the definition of corruption and collusion.
TrainSen	0	well he was the greatest Yankees Manager ever
TrainSen	0	Kelly made Idol. They owe her as much as she owes them. She is an international superstar because of her voice and hard work not because of Idol. Kelly would have been famous with or without Idol because she lives for music and has a gift from God.

TrainSen	0	is it april 1st??
TrainSen	1	F uck off loser colon cowboy. Go back to your boyfriend's filthy, dirty, hair, bacteria infested ass hole and hope that when you pull your c ock out it's not too brown. Or does someone else's s hit on your cock turn you on. You and your type are sick, disgusting perverts.
TrainSen	0	I like your style
TrainSen	1	and it's idiots like you wanting soviet bloc laws as long as they don't affect you. Your both retarded, and you need to go back and read the Bill of Rights and the Constitution again.
TrainSen	1	Clearly you're a fucktard. Not saying your right (or wrong), just saying who the fuck just randomly compares a rap group or any other MC on a post about a specific video and song about the dude's mama. Wtf does SH or any other MC or Hammerdance have to do with this song?
TrainSen	0	So you don't actually care about making women feel welcome as part of your professional community, which is generally impossible for a woman living in a sexist society to do (this one) when attention is being drawn to how her colleagues see her as a sexual object. Why don't you just admit it and be honest? I would feel really refreshed if someone like you said, for once, "We don't want women in our field." It would look stupid and ridiculous -- since why would you throw away half the available talent just because you want to sexualize everything? -- but then we could actually discuss the real point instead of derailing, dismissive, prevaricating, and dissembling discourse of which this one is an excellent example.
TrainSen	1	You're certainly what Lenin called a "useful idiot". If you like Islam so much, go where it is practiced "just the way you like it". Get to beat your wife and will, kill your kids for whatever reason turns you on, lie to anyone about anything just because "it furthers the cause of Islam" and others around you ACTUALLY BELIEVE YOUR LIES.
TrainSen	1	It's not being a Liberal that makes you like an idiot, it's when you try to defend this POS POTUS that makes you look like an idiot!
TrainSen	0	Why do you white people keep coming here trying to act like they are one of us. Go burn in the sun.

TrainSen	0	@Hoss Yeah, they came out with an album last week. First one in 5 years. It's pretty fucking awesome. Solid rock album.
TrainSen	0	So, you don't want to bring people out of poverty, Mitt? What exactly is this "safety net"? Welfare programs? I thought you and your ilk wanted to cut those. You're not concerned about some honest Americans who, sadly, sometimes have to eat stone cold cans of Chef Boyardee ravioli to live since it is "economical" ? You're not concerned about those who want a job? Or those who want a better standard of living? You were born into a <i>millionaire</i> aristocracy. You won God's "genetic lottery" Powerball before you were even born. You should consider yourself very lucky and try and help the less fortunate with your wealth rather than hoard it in a little tropical island. You, sir, are an complete asshole. What a selfish, callous, and bigoted remark to make. Nobody lives in poverty because they want to, Mitt.
TrainSen	0	But you're not at the game?

TrainSen	1	Quite sure your mama did too. Your dad should have went fishing the day he knocked up your mom. Can't stand you and I don't even know you. Kids have died and all you have are these ridiculous comments. Go fix yourself a nice plate of neckbones and rice. All I want isone little bone to get caught in that cesspool smelling throat of yours and kill you over. You know what? You probably banged ablack chick and she told youthat you didn't measure upand laughed you right out of the bed. Is that your problem?

Just because you show a story as to how a person became evil (such as in this case Maleficent or Wicked) doesn't make them any less evil! Idiots!
TrainSen	0	What do you care? you & your 'ilk' LIE every time your lips MOVE.
TrainSen	0	Read my post- I said "almost all money". Of course some tomatoes etc. might come from Mexico or someplace else but the major mark up comes at the supermarkets not to mention the suppliers who buy that foreign produce dirt cheap. Just consider that all those on foreign bases go out and blow their paychecks in other countries too. Even the raw materials and energy used for our military come mainly from abroad.\Facts are facts and Defense spending creates the least jobs and stimulus per $ spent for the simple reason that more funds go abroad than any other program.
TrainSen	0	I will go back to my lenses now and try to spice it up a little.
TrainSen	1	lol i diot we used your money lol what a waist of DNA you are.
TrainSen	1	eww i like BB but saying the rest of kpop isn't real music just makes you sound dumb as fuck. go back to your wonderfully lame articles and leave f(x) alone. also thanks for increasing our views count MUAHAHAHA.
TrainSen	1	That second year of fifth grad was a big fat waste of time. You are one sad, ignorant, liberal troll.
TrainSen	0	All that hatred inside of you must have eaten away what little capacity for clear thought you may have had. You lack the basic intelligence and knowledge to have real discussions or debates, so you come here insulting people into having arguments. Your insults are childish. You're proving all the negatives about your party every time you type. How about posting your picture... what are you ashamed of? You wouldn't have the balls to push all 'teh stupid' under your real name.
TrainSen	0	there is a lot of assad slave (shabihah) here fuuuck them
TrainSen	0	She can still come back...Brianti is not that good, Vika is just TERRIBLE today!!

TrainSen	0	Chavez is 5 for his last 21, dumbass. If you think that's "hitting better as of late," then I totally expect it, because you're too stupid to bring ANYTHING to the table. Just go out and play in traffic, will ya? You're a disgrace to O's fans everywhere.
TrainSen	0	You, Sir (Juan Williams), are doing "irreparable harm to the Court's reputation," by calling into question its integrity before a decision has been made. Moreover, it is shameful that the two Obama Justices are not standing up against criticism's like yours. Shameful? Political arguments and congressional vote counts should almost entirely no bearing on the Court's decision-making. I would expect more from you, Juan.
TrainSen	0	Deuteronomy 21:18-21:"If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, 19 his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. 20 They shall say to the elders, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard." 21 Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death." Matthew 5:18 : "I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished." You believers are dangerous.
TrainSen	0	jeffreed What makes you think that undocumented humans don't pay taxes?
TrainSen	1	Oh I think I do. Let's put it this way, it's not like watching United. Only muppets like yourself can see that's good football. Listen good on them for qualifying, but the football is dross and a 100 odd idiots posting here isn't going to change that. So think again about who the thickos are and add your name to the list.
TrainSen	0	Well, I don't like to use the word, unless it is special circumstances. But I was testing the limits of the free speech here, because your moderators claim that they don't censor anything. I actually find it sexist to allow the term "faggot" but not c*nt. 
TrainSen	0	Danco, don't be upset about not knowing about Wawa. They are regional according to one of the posts, found mainly in the East. (PA and NJ)

I hope he keeps going for a long time to come. I also love his TV show Chris Moyles Quiz Night, which is very funny. Each to his own and I respect that, everyone likes different people and I like him. He is certainly not fat and definately not ugly and he has a very nice face in my personal opinion!!

TrainSen	0	@Deepwater Horizon I know many people feel like this and I will never understand it. It's like saying that if your parents rob a store while pushing you in a stroller that when you turned 18 you should be arrested. I mean why wouldn't you want this young intelligent people that have grew up here to use there talents here. It seems silly to me, to waste all that talent. I'm happy he did what he did. Everyone is so concerned with right and wrong now but lets be practical. It cost money to send all these people back and your sending them back with there American education and talent.

TrainSen	0	The thing that keep the world from nuclear was was the understanding that a nuclear war could not be won.Even if one side was able to blow up the majority of weapons on the other side, the other side would still have enough to blow the other side up.There is a point that one can reduce the number of weapons to where nuclear war can be won by one side.I dont know exactly where the line is but if we cut too far, we actually could be creating a world far more dangerous than one with each side having 10000 warheads. 
TrainSen	0	@mahstah someone get this intel to america. the time to strike is nigh
TrainSen	0	okay now I know your trolling, good laugh, you had me for a while
TrainSen	1	I am sorry that your gay affirming inner-psych (opath) was disturbed (mentally) by my use of transgender; but a punk that is a male hiding behind a female screen name, has a myriad of issues (like your contributing zero to the conservative cause ass does too.) If you keep stalking bitch; I'll show you who's your daddy.
TrainSen	0	"Significant" - I think more like "Massive Fraud"! All the more reason to demand a 'picture ID' - either a drivers license of state issued\and tell Eric Holder to go suck an egg since he thinks that requirement would be 'racist'!It is past the time when we should 'guard' one of our nations' most honored privileges!\\\
TrainSen	1	tamrabam. you are a moron. I assume you vote labour. were you there, no , so shut your gob. Maggie had the balls to kick them out in no uncertain terms, non of our current leaders would do that now.

TrainSen	1	The key words being keep thinking, something you have a hard time doing redneck racist retard.
TrainSen	0	Again, why am I bothering. I'm not just suggesting, I'M STATING AS FACT that all these incoherent hypotheses are both illogical and irrelevant. If Travyon had been found on his back, with his arms spread wide, would that have indicated "Tampering !"? I have no clue what Trayvon did in his last seconds of life. We know he was shot from between 1 and 18 inches, in the chest, which is consistent with Zimmerman's story. Trayvon had at least a few seconds of life after he was shot, and who knows what his reaction was... judging from how his body was found, he crawled off Zimmerman and died. You don't have to roll someone over to check their pulse at the neck. I'm not quite able to figure out just what you're suggesting, but his position at death is irrelevant.
TrainSen	0	@ail Now why would you come up here talking about your mom like that...fall back son
TrainSen	1	Oh CJ, Cj, Cj, you fat ugly bitch! Its just so funny how much you NEED us! You need us to tell you that your husband would rather fuck a barbed wire covered glory hole than touch your 53 year old moldy vagina. You need us to tell you about the health problems your poor children are going to suffer thanks to your fast food and brownie diet. Poor tweenie is going to be teased in school for being tubby. You need us to tell you how stupid you are to go off of a fucking car thermometer to determine the outside temperature and then compare it to a fucking tropical climate state like Florida. How the hell do you function in life? Oh wait, you dont. You sit your fat worthless ass at a computer all day ranting about gay marriage. I hate to break it to you but I guarantee your darling son Sam is going to grow up to be the butt pirate you so hate. What are you going to do then? Throw a bible at his head? It wont knock the gay out of him! Even worse little Sara is going to grow up to be a...LIBERAL! Gasp! Oh nos! So your tweenie is going to be a fatty, sammy a gay, and sara a tree hugging hippie! Looks like your "christian" mothering sucks and you should try another route. Might I suggest getting the FUCK OFF THE COMPUTER and going to spend time with them?
TrainSen	1	so lets pamper the child so the child never does better. you are an idiot.
TrainSen	0	With 192+ Cease Fire violations we were treaty bound to resume hostilities, the only question is why didn't Clinton pull the trigger instead of look the other way.
TrainSen	1	It's been years and you birther idiots have yet to find ONE piece if evidence to support your claims, so who is the stupid one? You are gullible and ignorant if you believe our president was born in Kenya

TrainSen	0	Buck up little camper. Economics is cyclical, always has been always will be.. When there is enough buyers in the market, the price of your home will go up. I guarantee it.
TrainSen	0	 I have read yourcomment and I have to point-blankly ask you for one incidence where a personwas locked up for DUI that didn't blow over the legal limit or have a bloodtest that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t over the legal limit. Just give everybody even one example.Because anybody that truly was not DUI would have a serious law suit againstthe Macon police department and win big. So give us just one story...or is thiswishful thinking on your part? 
TrainSen	0	That was fucking sick
TrainSen	0	I don't agree with that either; Melissa I am born and raised here and I have seen first hand how this department and the judicial system work hand in hand. Mr. Small as you so elequently put it is a drug dealer but a majority of the upper class around here are; I could name a few but I won't we are profiled because we are not supposed to have nice things or money point blank...
TrainSen	0	lol Igor should be in it. He can penetrate people with his long ass nose.
TrainSen	1	Cheappathetic references to Nazi Germany, you dont know how good you have in this country A-Hole!
TrainSen	0	Conservatives are to blame for some of this for wimping out on it. Why are we not working on laws to ban gay marriage on a federal level and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not stop there? No gay adoptions we need a man and a woman in these kids lives. Regardless of what liberal propaganda tells us, conservatives out number liberals 3 to 1 why do you think fox is so big and liberal radio shows are basically non existent. Why is it 85% of Americans were against Obama care and yet because of the majority in congress it was passed anyway? Conservatives need to get off their keesters. In Arizona these things are not radical, there mellow. Start working on making homosexuality illegal start far to the right just as the liberals start far to the left and they get it (Obama care etc.) no this is the conservative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault. Gay people need to feel shame in what their doing, not heroic as the liberal media makes them sound. Make it illegal and that will help in giving them the shame they should already feel. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not right it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a matter of hate I guess I hate rapists to because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right either.If we glorified rapists and made them sound all heroic would it become a RIGHT to be who they are? That's how they were born. They didn't choose to be that way they just are so they should have the RIGHT to rape any man woman child or animal. This is the liberal logic. Next their going to want to pass laws that being a rapist is just sexual orientation. You would even see ignorant people trying to say the bible says its ok. If it were ok then 2 men could have a baby without help from any women and 2 women could have a child without using any sperm from a man. Nope sorry just not possible. 
TrainSen	0	Hasn't been pathetic yo, it will take a little while to get them back though, Mccourt actually trashed us.
TrainSen	0	You guys got to stop comparing him to Heath. If you go into the movie already thinking he will not be better than Joker than you are only ruining his performance yourself.
TrainSen	1	I pull nothing from you, Hanni. But, keep parroting me, in lieu of thinking for yourself. It will at least make you sound a little smarter than you really are.
TrainSen	0	her turkey sandwich sounds better than chicken nuggets at the school.school lunches suck.
TrainSen	0	Idiocy. Just say things then give no facts. Here's some facts. 3,000,000 people missing from the work force. The lowest workforce in 30 yrs at 63.2%. Median household income down 7%. Gas prices have doubled. Debt rising at a 4.2 billion dollar a day clip, and rising. 48% of Americans are below the poverty level. 46% more Americans on food stamps. Electric bills up 300 dollars a year. Average age of an American owned car 10 yrs. I can go on, and on. This POTUS is a joke. Look at his past voting records in Illinois and in the US Senate. Consistantly voting present or abstaining. He's a consumate politician. Strictly worried about covering his ass, and saving his job. Thank the stars he is alienating the Catholics. After that fiasco you can stick a fork in him, he's done. HGis IQ is on a par with the mouth breathers that voted for him. All he's got is those mean ole corporations, and class warfare. Only the uneducated will fall for that. There's a lot of them though.
TrainSen	0	Did you see the picture of President "Limber Neck" bobbing his head to the Mexican President on Drudge front page? http://drudgereport.com/
TrainSen	0	These descriptions of Zama might as well be SHAPE HS. The same divisions, nastiness, weak leadership in both the principal and the new assistant principal are as evident in Mons as in Zama. After Ms Fitzgerald cleans house in Zama, she should head directly to Belgium.
TrainSen	0	the difference is and this is a big one...you and fellow trolls live and feed off our blogs( ND's blogs ) "sharing" your " opinions" and comments "...with no interest in talking positively about ND football like us fans...your sole purpose is to antagonize us...if you really think about it, you and your idol, Strike First are a pretty pathetic pair ...
TrainSen	1	You suck. You probably don't have any friends. Your family probably abandoned you in disgrace. Go crawl back under a rock and do this world a favor and stop existing. You think you are cool because you think you understand the situation and call this man a coward and pathetic. Well congratufuckinglations. You just showed the world what a doouchebag you are. I don't know if its because you are emo or you think trolling will earn you respect but i don't give a damn. Go dig a hole, bury yourself in it and stay there. If you don't have anything good to say you better expect nothing back.
TrainSen	0	You will never get a job in Government, too much common sense and stating the bleeding obvious. Bettie Windsor and Diana Ross seem to prefer Northolt ( for different reasons ) so why not look again at the utilisation.

TrainSen	0	Maybe, and if so they are thieves as well. It makes no sense to bitch about the quality of the item you are stealing. If they were that shitty, I expect they would not be stolen.
TrainSen	1	Your point is as valid as the hole in your head that you obviously gave to yourself before making such an idiotic statement. And bringing politics into it? Could your trolling be more obvious?
TrainSen	0	fuck harry potter
TrainSen	0	I guarantee you are wrong. No way in hell the refs call five T's on Miami.
TrainSen	0	NO, NO, NO. The intention does matter. Outrage can't be justified by itself. The ignorant thing is the outrage, not the design. That goes for the Star tee and these shoes. People somehow got the idea that any outrage they can grow, is somehow justified just because they 'feel' it. Fuck that, let me wear shackles and stars and whatever else I want to. It's not killing anybody, it's not even fuckingreferringto whatever you want to feel outraged about. Please end this tsunami of holy outrage.

TrainSen	0	OK - so where am I going wrong wanting an "Earl Campbell"? If someone like that were available/
TrainSen	0	I see this morning they've already had one Komen health official resign in protest over the decision. The bad PR just keeps on coming. Pema, good job on focusing this story on the specific clinics like Waco that are going to feel this cut moreso than others. It's important in this instance for people to see the reality and what really happens when decisions like this are made for political, not practical, reasons. Please bring us more stories like this one.

He was later beat by The Bushwhackers in a handicap match" Looks like we got The Bushwhackers return up next.

TrainSen	0	fuckkkkkkkkk wfd
TrainSen	1	this post is so shallow and pathetic. Kudos to people who are growing old with out trying to defy the laws of nature, and half of your posts are merely bad pictures you are trying to write off as "not growing old well". Must be a slow news day because this is truly an all time low.
TrainSen	0	That is because you are not a fan. Go watch the Heat with the rest of the bandwagon jumpers in this town. So very sad.

TrainSen	1	Your an IDIOT!
TrainSen	0	Sadly, the Catholic church has many criminal molesters, most of whom are homosexuals.
TrainSen	0	This has got to be the stupidest story I have ever read. Yes, the USDA regulates school lunches that they prepare, on campus in their cafeteria. They do NOT control what parents can pack and send their kids to school with in their lunch boxes. If I were that mother, I would send my kids to school the next day with a big ole bag of Doritos a whole pack of cookies and a bottle of Mountain Dew, with a note attached to the lunch box that says "My mom says you can suck it"
TrainSen	1	Your an idiot
TrainSen	0	...HORSE TRAINER my AZZZZ...TRUCE...?
TrainSen	1	How do we know Terry Krepel is your real name. If you are not a gutless coward, you'll provide an address and phone number. Now, we are paying attention...don't be a gutless coward and p*ssy!
TrainSen	1	idiot nayar you are mother fucker. you are saying attack on Shri harmandir sahib was a right action, this shows you negative thinking about sikh community. All siks are agree with building memorial thats why any sikh organisation does not oppose. You have no concern with issues of punjab. The wording you used in this article is very rude and this shows your hate about sikh community,,,,,,you are barking dog,,,we don't care you
TrainSen	0	Have you always been a victim?
TrainSen	1	You are either very ignorant or terrible at sarcasm
TrainSen	0	@rafaelinho10 ya right that shit is pathetic. Its the same software as 6 years ago. Apple adds a few features, most of which could be done by downloading an app, and you isheeple cream your pants. Man it would suck to be as narrow minded as you all lmfao
TrainSen	0	Madison, I admire you for sharing your story. You are a wonderful inspiration! I only found your blog about a month ago and love it! Thank you for opening up like you do.
TrainSen	0	Yep people can be pretty dumb -- exemplified by your #1 argument.
TrainSen	0	@Cruxen Good. Actually, really good. And it's good to know that I remind you of the Delta, hahahaha. How's it with you? Are you still early morning cblogging with Dap?
TrainSen	0	I find it funny how some fans are more worried about whose better or how many albums they sell instead of just enjoying the music. Some fans need to get their priorities straight.
TrainSen	1	Chris, please stop commenting, because you're obviously still trying to catch your breath from your sucking off Cook. This has made you more retarded than usual.
TrainSen	0	Did you read the article? They never married. And YOU do give a crap because you're commenting...
TrainSen	0	Looking up a definition doesn't make me an authority on labeling people. Therefore, your diagnosis is invalid.
TrainSen	0	Romney is the Etch-A-Sketch man. A term given to him by HIS OWN campaign staff. Beware.

TrainSen	1	Lol man your gonna call him a loser and to get a life when you are on here sticking your nose in their business?? Your a douche bag who probably has never even seen a vagina. Go get laid and see that there is more to life than being a Dick like you obviously are.
TrainSen	0	Maybe they will create a black hole that will suck in the entire facility.
TrainSen	0	Internet threats are just threats, stupid punks, I hope. We have to worry about the violence that takes place in parking lots after the games.
TrainSen	1	@TeeBooWa HAH YOUR'E ONLY 14? FPFF AND YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO? I'M WAAY OLDER THAN YOU WHO YOU CALLING A BITCH AND A FUG? YOU DOUCHE BAG BITCH I WANNA PUNCH YOUR EYEBALL OUT AND KILL YA FUCKYA

TrainSen	0	aaahhh, how sweet...read your post ...it is the sign of an enabler...oh yeah, but aaaah, how sweet...puke
TrainSen	0	Sic? Because you spelled it "center" or because you think it should still be called SkyDome?
TrainSen	1	You're probably a phuuking dyke...aint ya beotch ?
TrainSen	0	gulfstream69: We have many social nets for people and if you're not taking advantage of them during tough times and claim to be 'poor', you are just stupid. Poor are people in the slums of Indian or the Sudan. Amerians don't understand the true meaning of poor.
TrainSen	0	What are you smoking, Rucker? There's no enthusiasm for Romney anywhere except maybe among some Mormons...and probably not even all of them. No, it's simply that Obama has turned out to be such a miserable loser, that anyone else will do.
TrainSen	0	fucking hell
TrainSen	0	Marriage is a worthless ceremony, almost as worthless as religion.
TrainSen	1	You're a liar. I was on that night dealing with two of you trolls an hour before anyone showed up. This isn't a physical fight here on this screen, you moron. In order for what you say to be the truth, I'd have to sit back and say nothing while others fight for me, and if that were so, you would never have been reading me for some time. It's one thing for you to be a liar, but quite something else for you to be a STUPID liar.
TrainSen	0	We are crap, you said it yourself.
TrainSen	0	No Brees = tank season for Bradley and start over Simple as that.
TrainSen	1	Steve,go brush your teeth with a revolver you dumb bastard
TrainSen	0	Dimwits. They prevent Eric Holder from stopping the guns getting sold in massive quantities to people about to go into Mexico, and then they get all apoplectic. Where did Monica Lewinsky's dress go - are they sniffing it before their tirades so they can psyche themselves up?
TrainSen	0	Mo ain't coming back and getting close to 15 million he got this year. Be realistic he is very old athletically. He will pitch one last time and then retire like Wood did.
TrainSen	0	Truths? Are mine the same as yours?Speaking the "truth" often involves hurting peoples feelings.For instance if I were to state I believe homosexuality is a chosen life style unlike being born a racial minority.Or if that I believe that that chosen\lifestyle is amoral and perverse, not far from the vestiges of pedophilia, bestiality, or nechrophilia.And, it's got absolutely nothing to do with religion. Now there's a whole pile of truths for you.
TrainSen	1	That has to be the stupidest comment I've ever seen.
TrainSen	1	We have more where he came from. Don't rest, we are watching your fat azz.
TrainSen	0	I am liable to go to a 7-11 for a pack of cigarettes some day and the guy or gal behind the counter will take my money and hand me a live grenade! I don't see many Americans behind the counters at 7-11 or Kroger's or the gas station or the bank. Do we have any born here Americans left who have jobs? This reminds me of the guy who was at a bar and a big muscular biker walks in and takes his drink away and drinks it! The little guy says "I went to work late and got fired...I went home and my wife was in bed with a stranger and then my dog bit me. I took my last 5 bucks here and bought a drink and dissolved some poison in it to kill myself and you come along and drink my drink! So...how was your day?"
TrainSen	0	What are you talking about? Zimmerman wasn't police and Obama isn't black.
TrainSen	0	In my area the scrap men and women are around everyday sometimes one in the morning and a different one in the afternoon,that includes weekends. If you leave anything on the path it goes. I left a spin dryer for my cousin to pick up on the driveway when I went to work,before he could pick it up the scrap people opened my gates and took it.
TrainSen	0	Those evil Syrian soldiers are eating babies, and the helpless civilians only want peace. Why are the evildoers winning? Why can't the white knights of pure Western goodness go do something about it?
TrainSen	0	"...erections."Then why are they targeting women?
TrainSen	0	Nope, I'm fecking huge and I'm from Leeds. Also, since when was Aberdeen in the north of England?
TrainSen	0	you are right - if only we knew which balls were which and whos balls were in whos pockets - we would then at least know how many balls were still on the table and in play - :)
TrainSen	0	@YinzerinCTThat took me about 2.76 seconds
TrainSen	0	Because you are so cool, that's why!!!!
TrainSen	0	It looks to me like the federal government wants Florida to let illegals and non-residents vote. Those are the votes Obammy needs. The law and truth means nothing to the federal government. All it cares about is getting a second term for Obammy.
TrainSen	0	You're kidding. Right? Do you read the news?
TrainSen	0	vector comming from some-redneck like you i that it as a compliment. some goes for cslos77 Been call a idiot by a redneck always give me a smile

TrainSen	0	@hamm5 @DawgJamFan I'm not sure their is a "prototype" build for the rush OLB in Grantham's scheme. It is basically whoever can get to the QB best. I think Jenkins definitely projects outside as well as Floyd. JHC could definitely play outside, but I think he is the only one in this class who could also lock down the inside as well.
TrainSen	0	Santorum needs to stop whining about the negative adds - he's been free-riding at Newt's expense this entire time so now it's his turn in the box. After all, he's a lawyer and needs to suck it up - but of course he doesn't want people to know he's an attorney since that might spoil his choir boy image. Newt said he wasn't for mandates so rick needs to stop promoting it. Besides, rick didn't mind piling on with Mitt to try to bury Newt early on. But at the end of the day, what solutions does rick bring to the table? He didn't do anything when he was in congress and time after time he ABANDONED HIS PRINCIPLES TO PLEASE THE LIBERALS IN PENNSYLVANIA! And what did it buy him? A 19 point drubbing in his re-election! As for the campaign, he's brought no rational or reasonable solutions to the table - instead, like mitt, his best solution has been to say "I agree with Newt" - and his economic logic is elementary and fatally flawed. Newt has been spot on predicting where king hussein obama is leading us, including the attack on the church, which is simply the avenue to establish the legal precedent that the WH has the power to tell us - all of us - how to act, how to respond, and what to think! That's the real issue from obama and his henchwoman michellivelli! Not only will rick be behind on tidal wave of rot that will flood him if elected, he will not be able to get congress to do a darn thing! And when his failed 4 years are over, the demonic dems will come back to power with a vengence by simply pointing at rick's miserable record and lack of ability to lead in a hail storm of enemies on both sides of him! So rick should just suck it up, stop whining and run the gauntlet like Newt has had to ... if he can't stand the heat then he can't lead the country!
TrainSen	1	let me rephrase: In other words, you are an insane pussy.
TrainSen	0	Why don't the Koch brothers get off their fat ass wallets and actually run for office ... oh ... right ... they would LOSE in a crushing landslide.

TrainSen	0	@Rourke needs to give me a fucking likeI am from a family of nurses. They are much more liberal than I am (my sister in law supports a single payer system, I support getting rid of the hypocratic oath and the AMA). I have gotten their diagnosis, even had them get me scripts from their diagnosis.
TrainSen	0	I'd agree. Very friendly town, and it's friendly with depth. I've lived in other areas where people are 'friendly' but it's more of a politeness with little warmth.
TrainSen	0	and .. have you made a conclusion yet? We're gonna buy a 7d tomorrow the plan was with a 18-135, what did you not like about it.. what would you recommend?
TrainSen	0	Once demtards figure out how many HoHo's are appropriate for a public vending machine, republicans can lead this country once again. Then the demtards can go fantasize about making the.cock they suck their husbands. Sissyboys!

TrainSen	0	@dale0987654321 @'Micah Carter So you're saying those claims are all false...? I don't know... just from my understanding these are in his book... but I can be wrong... I'm just saying if they are true...should I just assume he's racist? From 'Dreams of My Father',"I CEASED TO ADVERISE MY MOTHER'S RACE AT THE AGE OF12 OR 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites"From Dreams of My Father, " I FOUND A SOLACE IN NURSING A PERVASIVE SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AND ANIMOSITY AGAINST MY MOTHER'S RACE".From 'Dreams of my Father', "The emotion between the races could never be pure... the THE OTHER RACE (WHITE) WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN JUST THAT: MENACING, ALIEN AND APART"From Dreams Of My Father, "never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. IT WAS INTO MY FATHER'S IMAGE , THE BLACK MAN, THE SON OF AFRICA, THAT I'D PACKED ALL THE ATTRIBUTES I SOUGHT IN MYSELF.From Dreams Of My Father:"THAT HATE HADN'T GONE AWAY," he wrote, BLAMING WHITE PEOPLE,- SOME CRUEL, SOME IGNORANT, sometimes a single face, sometimes just a faceless image of a system claiming power over our lives."

An American fuck you in the ass ?
TrainSen	0	Listen: I am anti killing, but I am not anti guns. I am anti DUI, but I am not anti cars. I am anti dog bites, but not dogs. I am anti shop lifting, but I am not anti merchandise. I could go on and on. I am anti gay marriage but not anti gays. \Get the picture.

TrainSen	1	Maybe you should read thatfirst sentence you wroteagain slowly. You are bending over to far to makean illogicalpoint. We are starting to see your ignorance.
TrainSen	0	You have got to be fucking kidding me! LMFAO! You have got to be the most naive fan or you're just a troll.I'm assuming you're just a troll. Not all of your oppars and unnirs are virgins sweetie. This is the 21st century. It's rare for anyone to wait until marriage, EVEN in Korea.
TrainSen	0	Because in Bills world he is always right and everyone else who disagrees is a pin head.Or a zealot or a bigot. The man is a boar and bombastic. That sells you say. I will predict that his rein at the top is over, He inadvertently thought that his viewers were so sucked in that they would buy anything he says as gospel. He underestimated his audience badly. It pissed him off that the meek would dare to question his almighty wisdom. There are many people going to be raised up these days to try and prevent the takeover of this county from the rich establishment trying to tell the people what they should do. What we have found out is that most of Fix have the same agenda as the dems,.To be in control! Thats whats going on here. To control the money the masses and the airwaves. Keep you distracted so you wont notice whats really going on. Another Sun Tzu law. Never underestimate your opponent, Big mistake . Tonight they are trying to remind the people their job is to root out the facts. Sorry Bill it wont work with people who see a fix when its in. Trying to say a poll that was flooded by romney people would make it even. Look at all the other polls on these sites that you didnt get to promote on your show. Of course the moneyman would see to it you were"fair"Thats how you make your money. Just step outside for a minute while we kill mitts opposition and when it happens you start talking about all the lies and negative campaigning.Horse feathers. Anybody who isn't for romney sees it very clearly.Hmmm You will know when the next ratings cycle. Because thats what you are to them people. His rating numbers.They mess up that fair and balanced bit and the gig is up. He knows your hot buttons and he pushes them all the time doing what the elite do. Read these boards and laugh at how stupid these folks are. Its easy to get you to do or say anything they want. You are played like a deck of cards and you cant even see it. I am just a voice crying out in the wilderness with the hope at least one person hears me.Have you noticed not one Mormon has desputed the facts about that cult.Make them prove its a lie with sources not neighbors. Ever seen one rebuttal that was fact based. My word is try saith the Lord. Stay frosty. "I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life." (Revelation 22:18,19)(NIV)-BibleGatewayin regards to the NIV changes the word. Let not your heart be troubled for these things must come to pass. Do not resist for this is the way it shall be. Brought to you by The Holy Spirit.and you know who. 
TrainSen	0	You are still anonymous though.
TrainSen	0	@totnumfan Just about goalkeepers?They laugh at everything they will never have.They don't even know the meaning of the word ''legend'',since they have hardly ever had one. 
TrainSen	0	Too thin? Yes that is what she said, while laughing and pointing, and then serving me divorce papers. :( 8mm is about as thin as I think it should be. Just my preference.
TrainSen	0	Jennifer you need to learn to be by yourself. You do not need a man.
TrainSen	0	They will, but I still think they will not have as much gusto as they would have if it were Santorum.
TrainSen	0	I'm single, and but when I haven't been, I was with guys who regarded Valentine's Day as a "card holiday," even though they never even got me so much as a card. It makes me sad when I think about that. But I realize now that while romance is nice, I have a wonderful daughter who loves me just the way I am, and we're going to take the day to have some fun (and I'm planning on making her some cupcakes and buying her a little present, too) and appreciate the fact that we have each other. :)
TrainSen	0	HOLY FUCKING SCHNITT! he called pete raping gertude (doppeltrudy), the au pair "having an affair"-- there are no words...
TrainSen	0	Making fun of Catholics is not "edgy".It's childish."Edgy" involves risk.It's not like the Catholics are going to issue a Fatwa and encourage people to blow her up.Want to be "edgy", Ms. Minaj?Do the same thing to Muslims.I triple dog dare you. Minaj is just a flash-in-the-pan who tries to "shock" in order to hide the fact that she's not particularly talented. 
TrainSen	0	Having a high intelligence is also generally inverse to being a Republican, so it's not all bad.
TrainSen	0	@KeithB18 Isn't he though? "Someone's talking shit about a unit I've talked shit about. Pure blogging gold."

TrainSen	0	I went to see the Grateful Dead there on acid a few times years ago and I never fell. whats the deal with this new younger stupider generation of clean cut short haired yuppie non drug users who fall and die?
TrainSen	0	Why doesn't Kenny just send out some staffers to pose as new Canadians? That'll distract 'em.
TrainSen	0	Pelosi is one of many, who is standing behind the most criminal, obummer. But if they stood really close together you couldn't tell them apart. They both, along with holder and all the rest of-em, are outstandingly/extremely deadly. They all look like death warmed over.But don't trust any of them. They look dead because they are dead, but they are the dead that can kill you if you aren't careful. I hope there will be some good news soon. I'm sick of this whole damn mess and more so, I'm hoping that We, The People, will have learned the lessons we're being taught on horrible government, from the horrible governmental places where the dumb are in those schools of law, all the way to the White House.
TrainSen	0	SEE WHAT YOU GET FOR TRUSTING OBAMA ,CANADA LOOK OUT YOUR NEXT
TrainSen	0	@Mineola @Powkat How 'bout if some of those "Catholics" stood up to their own bishops. "Catholics" choose a hierarchical structure that lets bishops speak for them.
TrainSen	0	The only thing Murray is going to beat is his racket against the ground. Nole in 3 easy sets.
TrainSen	1	Poor deluded psychopaths. News flash, marriage is UNNATURAL. It is a construct of beings that have stepped out of nature for the most part. Construction, vehicles, technology.. all "unnatural" if you think about it. Now, if you're talking about the pairing off into couples by animals in nature, sure.. they do that. But it has never been about property rights for them, like it used to be for humans. And there are same sex couples in nature as well, since it's about making life easier in groups than it is by yourself. So, by THAT fact and the logic that goes with it, gay marriage is AS natural as hetero marriage. You fuckers never have a reasonable leg to stand on.. it's always your invisible sky fairy and some bullshit some cave dweller spewed 1800 years ago. Step into the age of enlightenment, you might like it.
TrainSen	0	All the more reason to slap the dog shit out of them RT"TenkYouPlease: Alcohols got you feeling like you cant get slapped"
TrainSen	0	He isnt a 100% satirist. He's actually very cordial in person...and does in fact use his iPhone day to day.
TrainSen	1	Chavez is a total joke at the plate, an automatic out. He's only decent as a late-inning defensive replacement. You'd know that if you weren't so f#cking stupid. We have Pearce, Betemit, Flaherty, and Andino (once BRob comes back) to take over in the outfield until Reimold and Markakis get back. None of them will make anyone's All-Star team, but they all look like Babe Ruth at the plate compared to Chavez. Grow a brain, for chrissakes. Your ignorance is appalling.

TrainSen	1	What a selfish slutbag. That fucking fat ass chubby cheeked bitch probably got mad because her precious baby boy was hungry. How DARE he eat food! Not only do children require food to grow and become helathy adults, but this bitch probably fed them HoHo's and Twinkies. I can just hear her now "Get off my food you little shit! That's MY MotherFucking Twinkie! Momma's got the munchies!" Then, WHACK with a fucking hammer. What a cunt.

TrainSen	1	Tom, you are an idiot on. You suffer from whitmenitis, aka, you find it easier to blame others for your mediocre life achievements. Truth of the matter is, you simply do not have much to offer.

TrainSen	0	What if teapiss and Beckel mated, fat bastard from Austin Powers.
TrainSen	0	I think they done lost their patience for this BS. I don't think they are going to wait any longer either. They will blow it up with or without the US's A-OK. Israel is right they can't wait for Iran to get more of a stockpile. They need to get rid of that or it makes it much harder for everyone else later to blow it up. Russia and China definitely aren't going to take to kindly to massive contamination heading their way if they don't do it now. The US should just be ready with cement to entomb the dam things.
TrainSen	1	And you are a weak bully!
TrainSen	0	You are soo right.Muslims fight Muslims everywhere.Muslim men degrade Muslim women,everywhere. Until all this can be repaired and Muslims become \xf6ne people", you will not go forth. You have about as much chance of this,as I have to see Rocking Horse Dung.

TrainSen	0	This is about 10 years overdue! The only real answer to all this killing is to get the troops out and let the <i>People</i> of Afghanistan, and not their American appointed puppets, choose their local governments as they have been doing for thousands of years.

TrainSen	0	We need Thames to take his spot and run with it, he does done very little to justify Snider being in the minors.
TrainSen	0	Thank you for your thoughtful and informative post Lisa. You covered the pros and cons of public opinion and didn't shy away from stating your own. Kudos. I feel it's your duty to say where you stand in full transparency and to balance the press that SGK is getting for the opposite reason. If both opinions are not provided then only ONE opinion will be weighed. Readers deserve both. The difference is that you stood for yourself, not for Elisa or Jory. SGK leaders weren't so transparent, they instead used the entire organization to front their personal mission. Our online "voice votes" carry far more weight than the political elections. Once women understand that, they'll understand their responsibility to say what they think often, loudly, and with civility. I am very dismayed by SGK's stand because it is playing to politics and not helping women. I will not be supporting SGK any longer. There are many places that are more focused in their mission to help all women, Planned Parenthood is one of them. When I was a starving college student, PP was my primary health screener. Later I did volunteer work at PP to pay back for my healthcare; one of the things we were trained on was how to check yourself for lumps and why it was important. They have been consistent in their mission to help all women stay alive and healthy often during the most dire of times.
TrainSen	0	As did underlying, I think. Honestly, the price action doesn't make allot of sense to me, but I 'll certainly take it

TrainSen	0	The GOP has already lost this election because of all the focus on anti-gay and anti-abortion rhetoric.These are ugly divisive issues that cannot EVER be won. If you can't beat a very unpopular president during bad economic times, who can you beat? Time to stop pandering to the shrinking social conservative Base and return the focus to taxes, national security, and job-creation proposals. 
TrainSen	1	You must be one of the dumb ones. Here, let me explain it to you... when you have an inflated catheter inside you, pulling it out WILL cause permanent injury. There is nothing for this man to "get over". He's been damaged and needs to be made whole again. Pay the man. And YOU, you need to go out to your local dollar store and buy yourself a new brain, the one you have currently doesn't seem to be working.

The company, whose filing follows years of losses and months of public discussions with bondholders, said it would sell its United Solar Ovonic unit and other assets in bankruptcy. Energy Conversion, whose solar laminate products are used for panels on rooftops and buildings, said it would continue to operate during the sale process.

TrainSen	0	No you are not "born" craving something deviant, by definition. It's a dumb argument. However, as I said, sick deviants have a right to do as they wish in their bedroom. But it is deviant, and abnormal, and they need to keep it out of everyone else's face. All I am saying. Enough with the disgusting gay pride parades, etc.\

TrainSen	1	No shut up. Black people don't need to be 'approved of' or 'pretty enough' for the Korean people. Fuck that shit. I am SO sick of black fans thinking that way. Truth is most Korean people don't find dark skin beautiful. Period. They also stereotype us as criminals and slutty. It's not US that need to change to fit their ideals, THEY have to change their backwards assignorantracist way of thinking. So you can take your 'Michelle is not idol material' and shove it please.
TrainSen	1	Your syntax is pathetic.And you are a cocksucking batshit motherfucker to boot.
TrainSen	0	@Lestatdelc@The_Godwhacker You're commenting using pure stereotypes and ignorance. First of all Obama has surged thousand of troops into Afghanistan, killed US citizens without a trial and passed a law that would allow indefinite detention of US citizens. Sounds like perpetual war to me.\\\\\Second of all, Ron Paul is for bringing all our troops home and closing all our foreign bases. So, when you say he voted for perpetual war, your not looking at his legislative record. Ron Paul is known as the most anti-war politician of either party. So, next time you decide to write a comment, do some reading before you put your foot in your mouth because you've made yourself into a completely ignorant as... Uninformed people like yourself is the reason this country is such a mess. You don't have the slightest idea of what you're saying. \\\\I ask, when will this wave of perpetual idiocy of voters who have the memory of a two year old and vote based on the latest campaign speeches and smears without checking a candidates legislative record?

You also fail to mention that juries are usually made up of people who are generally civic minded and respectful of the legal process, so they aren't usually sympathetic of little assholes who merely wish to engage in physical confrontations.

TrainSen	0	Your rant is typical of a believer - filled with anger towards those who espouse common sense and who realize that science can answer our questions and solve our problems- not superstition. You attempt to assign 'good' to your biblical god but this same god commanded his followers to murder innocents and condoned rape and human sacrifice. Perhaps you should read your bible with an open mind.

It still has several big numbers left to tick (as some of the guys from work, and I, go back).

TrainSen	0	please stop the money going to Pakistan...also please stop travel for British citizens to this destination unless vetted and okayed by the authorities, they are free to come and go as they please back and forth...also I say ban the sending of money wire transfers back to that counrty from the U.K...you only have to walk down the high streets of East London and you will see the amount of places where you can send money to there with no I.D needed!
TrainSen	1	you are a friggin moron. Oh you didn't get the memo? Sorry YOU ARE A FRIGGIN MORON!!!!
TrainSen	0	Xanax was her death blow. \That stuff is totally dangerous because you build a tolerance to it so quickly and if you stop abruptly, you could d ie. It is so insidious because you keep taking it more and more and it affects your memory to the point that you forget how much you took. \You take more because it loses it's "high" effects yet its memory destroying effects get worse and you get to a point that you don't even know what you are doing anymore. \Mix some serious partying in and you have a recipe for disaster. \She probably was so drunk and drugged that she didn't know how much Xanax she took, (you can easily forget that you took a dose if you have been high on them for days) went up to her room, took another big dose which was the kil ler dose and the rest is history.\

TrainSen	0	G-d, you rally are an idiot! The article talks of deportation. And, you're talking about lynching? What next Anna? Is your little mind going to start imagining concentration camps in the Negev? With mass gas chambers & cremetoriums? How many sub-Saharan refugees has your country welcomed?

Have you been living under a rock for thepast decade? Our Consitution (Bill of Rights) is being shredded! The US is trying to suck Uzbekistani balls for the energy game and to establish US forces in the region to "contain"Chinese influence in their OWN BACKYARD! (The Usbek gov't makes China look like a bunch of liberals!)

TrainSen	0	Amanda! Wish you lived closer!! I'm sure your moms are way better ; )
TrainSen	0	everything in your post that I am replying to has nothing to do with what is taking place.We have a president who is wiping away all state rights in an effort to control everything via the whitehouse.USA does mean the United States of America after all.The guy is desperately attempting to even have Americans suck it up and betray their core religious belief's because it won't jib with his "centralized government" ideology.I suggest you get over it sir, what he is doing is not American in any way shape or form.And I don't remember complaining about taxing, I have been complaining about the spending.Your trying to put the cart before the horse, not going to fly sir.
TrainSen	0	Republicans are disrespectful and really don't care about the American people...this has nothing to do with F&F. They really just want to make the President look bad. Their are real issues out that to focus on!!!
TrainSen	0	hey media matters spin this... the democrats under dear leader harr reid havent passed a budget in 1022 days exactly . the clueless white house budget director tried (rather pathetically i might add...)\to blame it on the REPUBLICANS? he\says its because they need a 60 vote super majority\which they dont...they just need a simple majority...WHICH THE\"DO NOTHING DEMOCRAT CONGRESS" HAS HAD FOR THE LAST 1022 days. so what is the excuse? Because they dont want to have to force their vulnerable members seeking re-election to have to vote on a budget that should offend hard working taxpayers. and if they dont have a budget printed out then its easier to blow that budget out of the water without taking the heat they deserve. its time the people that owned the white house , the senate and the house for the first 2 WHOLE YEARS of this idiots administration to own up to the mess they "created or saved"\\
TrainSen	0	Okay Booby, I don't let my kids watch FOX cartoons or shows after 7 PM, because they sell and push sexual promiscuity no family values. I'm merely pointing out all the ass-clowns who are being duped by this International Media Giant that has an agenda. There is nothing Fair and Balanced about FOX, and they are definitely not promoting Family Values. But they are very good at packaging it so morons believe they are.. So by all means continue to be programmed and watch your FOX news. 
TrainSen	0	Yeah its difficult if your chick thought you didn't give a fuck, and then all of a sudden you act like you can't live without her. On the bright side though, now she knows you do give a fuck. Which is a good thing. Now though, the only play is to back off, and let her miss you.
TrainSen	0	This place will become another millenium dome.. spurs are not a big enough club for this sort of stadium...

TrainSen	0	But, Dante, with all due respect, you ARE a hard core partisan. You DO NOT accept facts which counter your stated positions. You falsely call government websites "right wing blogs" You NEVER furnish a documented fact in support of your own positions while demanding them of others. You REFUSE to even DISCUSS any opposing positions in a civil manner, choosing instead to call your conversants, liars, stupid, etc. In short, your posts DEMONSTRATE you to be a hard core ideologue, devoid of ANY ability to think critically.
TrainSen	0	You have to have a truly twisted and evil mind to think up something like this bill. Could it be one of ALEC's concoctions?

TrainSen	0	<strong>Whom the Gods Would Destroy</strong> It seems that<strong> Obama, in a classic act of hubris, has created the means of his own destruction.</strong> Through his great historical contribution, his health care bill, he has struck what was surely<strong> intended to be a lethal blow against the oldest organization on earth -- an organization with something on the order of a billion members, with a cadre of hundreds of thousands of highly trained and dedicated personnel, and a history of overcoming political threats that make Obama look like a kindergartner. I'm referring, of course, to the Catholic Church</strong>. Now, I don't mean that the Archangel Gabriel will appear out of the East to scourge the administration with a blazing sword, though I would pay to see that. What I'm saying is that <strong>Obama has at last taken the step that we all knew he had in him, the ultimate act of arrogance and contempt that will bring the forces of history down upon him.</strong> The left has always underestimated the Catholic Church. "<strong>How many divisions has the pope?" Stalin once asked Molotov, mocking the Church's powerlessness in the modern era. He was not around to see John Paul II rend the Bolshevik kingdom in twain at the climax of the Cold War, utilizing the only forces he required: moral certainty and absolute faith in the divine mission.</strong> Most American leftists are a little different, viewing the Church as an anachronism, obsessed with medieval ideas having no place in the third millennium and populated with strange figures in outmoded clothing, if not with an endless parade of child-molesters. <strong>What they overlook is two thousand years of history</strong>. An organization does not survive for that length of time -- and no other organization has -- without internalizing things not completely understood by even the deepest thinkers among us. <strong> The Church survived the fall of Rome, the barbarians, the first Muslim upsurge, several schisms, the Renaissance princes, the 20th-century totalitarians, and its own plunges into decadence, and it will also survive modernism.</strong> Which is in fact what it confronts in Obama: a man of vast though superficial sophistication and little insight who has punched all the tickets available to him in his epoch and culture and truly believes there is nothing else. <strong> And now this man, afraid of revealing his own college transcripts, thinks he can take on the Church of Peter, founded a millennium before the appearance of any nation now existing on this earth.</strong> Read more: http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/02/whom_the_gods_would_destroy.html#ixzz1mKnbY0d3

TrainSen	0	Video: Breitbart vs. Cenk Uygar over rape at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d campsposted at 9:52 pm on February 14, 2012 by Allahpundit Via Breitbart TV. I should have guessed that eventually we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be arguing over whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has a problem with crime, notwithstanding the long, long, long, long, long list of alleged criminal activities at the encampaments. Remember, things at Zuccotti Park got so bad that a women-only tent was set up so that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be strength in numbers against sexual predators. Some feminist sites criticized \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for its rape problem back during the movement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brief heyday; even HuffPo reported on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmultiple incidents of assault, drug dealing and drug use, rape and attempted rape, according to conversations with numerous protesters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Per Breitbart in the clip, that detail apparently didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it into their book.) And of course, we only know about some of what went on. At least one \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camp reminded victims that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe do not encourage the involvement of the police in our community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a New York City cop told Big Journalism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Joel Pollak that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are many incidents of sexual touching and groping that goes unreported to us, mainly because the alleged victim is either too stoned or high to properly ID them or they \\xe2\\x80\\x98dont want to get the guy in trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Some national media outlets reported on the attacks too.) This is why, of course, Breitbart was yelling at the Occupiers outside CPAC to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstop raping people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but now that the movement is gearing up for a big spring comeback, I guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whitewash to being in earnest. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice bookend to their demagoguery over the Tucson shooting: In that case, tea partiers were blamed for a crime that no tea partier committed whereas here no Occupiers are blamed for a crime that quite a few Occupiers allegedly committed. Fourteen minutes, but well worth it. video http://hotair.com/archives/2012/02/14/video-breitbart-vs-cenk-uygar-over-rape-at-occupy-camps/

Oh boo fucking hoo, that mean man said "you're not special". I watched this thinking this guy is gonna be some jack ass and in reality, he gave a great speech and spoke some beautiful truth. You honestly must be the type of person who tries to make the Occupy movement look bad...Are you a fucking agent provocateur?

I hope you'll consider the lives of those people while you're debating this tough issue.

And that the "clunking fist" of "Mr Prudent" the "Iron Chancellor" had effectively "ended boom and bust" for us all (or had it?)? The Telegraph is disgracing itself by publishing this abysmal journalist with her badly thought-through and uninteresting nonsense.

TrainSen	0	I have not found one right wing fanatic in 3 kids in public schooll system in 12 years each.Not to mention the "parents" who man the property increase table for the "final" time every time. We need money for our buses or the buses wont run - then the tax is approved "again" and yet the buses wont run. Then next voting block - uh you are not going to have a fire dept, teachers, blah blah blah so lets give them all a raise that 75% cannot afford. so we lose our homes they get a raise - perfectly fair. I really think everyone needs to suck it up - no wonder they are worried about turkey sandwiches. God my parents would have been on prison for the Bologna spread that they ground up every week. But then again - we had to walk home we did not have a "car pool" taking us from step to step. My dad made milk from 1 gal add enough powdered milk to make 3 gals. Add to corn flakes = child abuse.

The more you open your mouth, the more you expose yourself for being a terrible mother, lousy friend, the absolute worst sister ever.You dont deserve to have your brother Joe, his super family, Jacqueline, Caroline, or cousin Kathy in your life.

TrainSen	0	Why would anyone listen or seriously consider any comment from Juan Williams. I'm a little confused as to why he is a FOX News contributor since he holds such extreme liberal views. Do you think MSNBC has any real Conservative on their network? Joe Scarbourgh\doesn't count as while he always says he is a conservative he is the biggest Republican and conservative basher on thier network, he makes Al (Fraken) Sharpton, Chris (I get\a thrill up my leg\everytime Obama speaks) Matthews, Ed (I couldn't find my ass with either hand) Schultz,\Rachel (AKA Pauly from the Wonder Years TV show) Maddow, and Lawrence (Yes, I'm an admitted Socalist) O'Donnell.look moderate. \

TrainSen	0	If you want to make your online marketing video viral, you must be updated with the latest technological advancements, and make use of that on your next video. For example, if the camera you're using is a little bit outdated and produces low quality videos, then it must be time to purchase a new one. Or, if your editing software has limited capabilities, get another one that offers more capabilities that will improve the quality and life of your video.
TrainSen	0	Just to educate you my brother, you and Kim may be the bigots. If he's liking your post because he's "Asian too".
TrainSen	0	The state is not dictating how catholic prey. It is not establishing a religion. Nor is it preventing Catholics frompracticing their religion with or without contraception. What it is doing is making contraceptives available on health insurance policies that Catholic owned businesses provide. Because it is available you dont have to use it. However those employed who wish to can do so.

TrainSen	0	@LadyAnne Where did you get your 3% fact?! I really want to know. I don't believe it for a second and would like to know where you pulled that number from. Abby Johnson (author of unPlanned) tells of her time with Planned Parenthood and how she would partake in budget meetings. They literally doubled their "quota" for abortions for the upcoming year to double the current year - and by "quota" I do mean that staff was being told to encourage twice as many abortions to meet these numbers. That is what Planned Parenthood is about.
TrainSen	1	Why is manber such a shit rapper?
TrainSen	0	@Rourke needs to give me a fucking likeMy biggest problem is licensing. I am actually kind of disapointed that the Republicans never touched Health Care when they had the majority. I wish they would have taken Milton Friedman's idea (one of the main influences of "Reaganomics") and taken the licensing power away from the American Medical Association. I trust nurses, and would have no problem with a nurse treating me rather than going bankrupt seeing a doctor.
TrainSen	0	Romney Steps In It With Gay Marriage Line Via Buzzfeed, which missed something of an attack angle from the right in this short Romney riff on gay marriage.

TrainSen	1	People like you are the reason the economy is failing.
TrainSen	0	I'm giving up with you now. Lying and Perverting the course of Justice are two completely different things which can't be used interchangably - it doesn't even matter what you say unless you are under arrest at the time as it is the actual arrest that gives them the power to repeat what you have said in court. As in "You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention something you later rely on in court. anything YOU DO SAY may be taken and given in evidence". So unless the passengers were arrested for your non-existant crime and then agreed to give a statement against the driver who was doing them a favour, who would then subsequently have to have admitted all wrongdoing in front of a judge. It isn't more likely than I think, it's probably even less likely than I think

TrainSen	0	I'll make a bold prediction now: If Dolan continues to beat this war drum, it'll blow up in his face. He is beginning to overreach; perhaps his elevation to cardinal is getting to his head.The president has compromised and granted broad exemptions to faith-based organizations with respect to providing health insurance products that violate their conscience. What more does the clergy want -- for the President to kiss the ring of the Cardinal? Soon this will become a story of Catholic leadership, whose moral standing remains questionable following the child molestation scandals, waging war against women and the president. Not a war they can win...

TrainSen	0	'Corporations are people' Google 'Corporate Citizenship'. "However, many also take it to mean that corporations should be regarded as citizens within a territory - i.e. that corporations have citizenship of some sort. This is usually based on the principle of corporate personhood, in that in certain legal jurisdictions, such as the United States, companies are afforded some of the same legal rights as individuals."

TrainSen	0	And we could put up a high-stakes Russian\Roulette\game, I'm sure a few people would "choose" to do that too. Like young girls "choose" prostitution, people "choose" to be crack heads... The fact that you can "blow the rent money on the roll of the dice" and leave your children homeless is case in point.
TrainSen	0	we need to have a honest goverment and clean up all communists from any party now

TrainSen	0	well, he wants to ban gay marriage even in states where it is currently legal, he wants to ban adoption for gay couples, he thinks Planned Parenthood has a "hidden agenda" and\he wants\No abortions even in cases of rape
TrainSen	0	there is a good team on the field idiot! People get injured, people slump! To say Gonzi and Youk are no better at hitting than the fans, is absolutely ridiculous and upsurd! Do RSN and the Red Sox a favor and stay at home and shut the f&ck up! You are a prime example of what I am talking about! If you're going to criticize then do it realisticly and stop pulling dumb Sh!t out of your A$$! As for the rabbits foot, I'm not talking about luck here. I am talking about a behavoir of the fans that is bleeding into the club house. You try and perform while constantly criticized and have to endure stupid comments like you. I'm not saying it is the main problem but it certainly does not help anyone!
TrainSen	1	you really are a complete moron, yo must be one of those incompetent welfare leeches who does nothing but put a drain on every hard working person in this country. Cut the cord, do something with your pathetic life.
TrainSen	0	really? since when has it become cool to defend him?
TrainSen	1	Nope, it is a moron like you who needs to shut up

TrainSen	0	"President Romney" sounds really good. Now, Cheney for VP and we're all set. Yeah, that's the ticket---Romney/ Cheney. And the motto will be "Just to piss off the Liberals".
TrainSen	0	Of course Iran has been talking us to death for years in their development of nukes. With Obama and Hillary they have willing allies to prolong it even further. The Israelis and believe or not the Saudi's and Jordanians will not wait for Obama knowing exactly who he supports. The Arabs have as much to lose because occupying them is also on Irans time table. Simply put the Iranians are shiite and the Saudi's and Jordanians are sunni they hate each other deeply. In this case Enemy of my Enemy is my friend at least for today.

TrainSen	0	tstev, you really ought to get a life. You accused me of being another commenter pretending to be a supporter of that commenter's stance in another article, long ago. You post more than anyone I have ever seen, and your posts are always vicious, petty and pointless and quick to whip out ad hominem attacks. You post so often that I wonder how do you, pray tell, make a living? Are you one of the 1%? Do you live in your parents' basement? I'm sure you'll accuse me of being yet another Abigail or something idiotic along those lines. By all means, deflect away from legitimate discussion. That's the height of maturity.
TrainSen	0	What Muslims are currently being line up for hate?
TrainSen	0	I feel bad for the woman. What would have made this story better is if the man attempted to rape her and she pulled a 9mm and gave that guy a dirt nap. but who needs guns, guns are barbaric. And rapes, murders and home invasions only happen in the movies and on TV. Instead this guy is gonna be in jail and all the liberals will think he is gonna be "rehabilitated" and he will become a contributing member of society on release.Such a waste of tax dollars.
TrainSen	1	Bitch,be quiet. Somebody needs to kick your ass for talkin' that stupid shit,hoe.
TrainSen	1	You are a complete moron

Having said all that there is an old snap of self on a dirt bike laying around somewhere with my young daughter clinging to me on pillion seat.. having fun but neither of us wearing crash hats.. i guess we all have rash moments. 
TrainSen	1	You piece of scum. According to the SA constitution, this lady was a Black person. Hope your mother is the mother of all old cows. Idiot.
TrainSen	0	Arsene Wenger is a great manager, of that there is no doubt, and i, for the life of me, couldn't understand that substitution...however, he is the manager not me, and he may have had a sensible reason for doing it, we don't know.
TrainSen	0	I feel like Shotime looked inside my dreams and just picked a bunch of random shit out of it to make a show: Sheen, Caplan, sex, period pieces, retro science and sex.

TrainSen	0	If you take out the fags and booze and such like, leaving say £170 per week say and then recognise that they are feeding 8 people then that doesn't seem too extreme (\£3 or so per day per person). I've no sympathy though because they should be spending their money more wisely given their circumstances.
TrainSen	0	Fuck Toygers I want a Mutini
TrainSen	0	First off...you do NOT need to be married to make end of life decision, or purchase health insurance together. So basically you just want to file a joint tax return?? Look, read any of my posts, I am for equal rights for all citizens. But it pisses me off when you have to make up phony benefits just to explain to some simpleton, religious nut, why you should also have the right to be married. Marriage is an institituion of the church...so why gays who are so hated by the church...would want to get married is beyond me. But it should be their right. A human being is a human being...period!
TrainSen	1	@caljb7 i'm on AAC then ya dumb fuck
TrainSen	0	More run support = more confidence when pitching = better results.
TrainSen	0	What did they expect when they ask miming quees " Ms.Cole" to appear. Did they think the rating was going to improve. I just think the judges arent very good and people are getting bored of these talent shows. Its the same thing over and over again.
TrainSen	0	It probably was a white guy high on drugs who looked Asian with his eyes half wayclosed.
TrainSen	0	They cant beat spanish players so they are trying these cheap shots...
TrainSen	0	I admire him, he is a true warrior king of old. The difference between a general and a warlord is that a general only follows orders, a warlord is only constrained by the rules he agrees to. It was a pathetic joke that Obama was given an honorary black belt in Taekwondo without earning it. Putin is a better man than that... your standards of measuring a man (even an adversary) is as pathetic. No, I think Putin is more honest than you will admit.
TrainSen	0	The M25 struggles to cope with airport traffic. Tube connections are not useful for all travellers. The infrastructure can't cope now!

TrainSen	1	smearedsxhit, what does the phrase below mean? I'm just (after all) a 'stupid teabagger, and you are a more intelligent corn filled Obamaballsniffer, so please explain this: "...I give Fox Nation 3 more weeks. Then it's off to stormfront for the baggers." What is 'stormfront?' Because, that is the same term 'Berthole' used last night when he/she/it was lurking on another thread. Could this mean that you are berthole, lindie and smellyterd!!! All rolled into one ignorant pieceofppppoop?
TrainSen	1	Do you realize how retarded, ignorant, sorry, and pathetic you sound?
TrainSen	0	Are you saying a woman's right to vote was revoked after 1920?
TrainSen	0	It's a quote people...chill the fuck out -.-
TrainSen	1	Substantiate your slur...or should we talk about the bi-sek'sual in the WH? Don't you think the name Larry Sinclair should be included in your internet 'whispering' campaign?
TrainSen	0	damn i need to stop regarding fuckign tvspot
TrainSen	1	Wally the bigot, and cmorris the racist. The new faces of ignorance for the new south. No matter how often they wash their black sheet, it will still carry the smell. Good luck guys, and all those like you. God has a special section for you to sit in when you arrive and your resting spot.
TrainSen	0	Thanks for demonstraing the idiocy of the bigot. I'm not gay, but support gay marriage. Try and compute that one, dimwit. Your birth certifictae was an apology from the condom factory.
TrainSen	0	Where on your body are you planning on getting it?
TrainSen	0	You have my permission to leave.
TrainSen	0	Romney's track record in elections is not particularly good when he comes face-to-face with effective politicians and campaigners (as opposed to has-beens and laughingstocks). Given how Rubin demeaned Gingrich and Santorum during the primaries, she can't really see Romney's nomination as some great achievement.
TrainSen	0	I would rather some one with "blood money"(although the you tube was with out merit) than someone with blood already on their hands like Obama.
TrainSen	1	You sir are not intelligent
TrainSen	1	Hey moron "William Reynolds", impeach YOURSELF and then go kiss a Muslim like your hero Bush.

TrainSen	1	I would slap you silly but clearly you are already there.
TrainSen	1	Really Joe? I don't recall anywhere in the"All My Children" storyline where little boys were raped and sodomized...refresh my memory please... But I guess you'd know all about children, since you impregnated a 16 year old in the past wouldn't you? You're as much a pos as your sicko client...
TrainSen	0	i dont care. I will never agree with you. In a few years we will know. Wait it out

TrainSen	0	Hey lawmanjed, don't let the trolls get to you -- they get off on being intentionally irrational because they know that you expect them to be rational. Just step over them.
TrainSen	0	Oooooooo, they might get Michael More on us. Great! He's about due for a stroke/coronary about now anyway. If Fox caused it, even better. Besides, isn't he a one percenter with his mansion and big ass-ets? 
TrainSen	0	One thing I've learned in 3+years. People that make childish plays on Obama's name or call him things such as the Messiah are really pea-brains.

TrainSen	1	It's clueless racists like you who are in complete denial. This boy WAS in fact killed because of his race. There is no "race card". So now that they mentioned race, you are no longer "behind them"? You're as sick as the bastard who pulled the trigger.
TrainSen	0	Wow if you can't get used to it then I don't know wtf to tell you. It should not be a surprise to see AKP post these things. You can choose not to click on it or if it's such an eyesore go to a different site for kpop news why don't you? You were directing your comment to the staff? Hm, ok sure. I don't see why you should post it on the comment section. And you don't know how many times I have to see comments about this article being useless. It's tiring and repetitive.

TrainSen	0	I love Cam Newton's upside, and think he'll be an All-Pro caliber QB, but 21 TD's and 17 Interceptions and NFL Network has him as the 10th best Heisman Winner to play in The NFL. Tebow was also on that list. ESPN had a problem with Tebow but never mentioned how stupid it was that a guy who had a "decent" year throwing the ball, for a bad team is suddenly on a list that Tim Brown is not on. I'm so tired of ESPN hyping things up and blowing them way out of proportion, for better or worse.
TrainSen	0	John, you need a female publisist...may I apply for this lifetime position in which I can attempt to enlighten you about our sex...you are soooo far away from ever finding a woman who will put up with your bullshit...where is your mother? Time for you to have a talk with her...

TrainSen	0	The thing that realy scares me, is that we (and by we i mean our security services) have to be lucky 100% of the time. scum like this only have to get lucky once. And how do the Goverment respond? they open our borders to the world and let thoughs who hate us hide behind the (in)-human rights act. Time we acted a bit more like the U.S.A and remove or lock up for life. And i mean LIFE, ANYONE who wishes to do us harm.

TrainSen	0	So if they look "normal" to you and they commit a crime, then what? I'm "not on board." You're "way off." Of all the ridiculous nonsense to base your judgment on someone by "how they look." I'm surprised you'd let people know how your "thinking" process works. Pretty pathetic, and part and parcel of the kind of nonsense that has surrounded this case from the very beginning.
TrainSen	0	Frankly, I'm disgusted with Detroit Tiger fans [?] for their cruel treatment of a true Detroit citizen Brandon Inge...and I'll never forgive myself for posting anything on this site. Am I ever happy for Brandon now, Adam Dunn too...everybody finds their own niche.

TrainSen	0	In my opinion, the odds are that, prompted by Tel Aviv, the NeoCons, and Christian fundamentalists in the Pentagon, a Romney Administration will attack Iran and commence a hundred year global religious war which everyone will lose. Regional alliances, constant combat, and widespread poverty will not be unlike the conditions described by George Orwell in his book, "1984."

TrainSen	0	While it is normally hard to rejoin a serialized drama once you stop watching, nothing ever happened on this show. While it had a great cast and a refreshing atmosphere, this show was so slow that at times I thought it might be moving backwards. Two seasons could have easily been one. The episode is a day in the investigation idea was probably the shows biggest error.
TrainSen	1	Fuck you.
TrainSen	0	Is that the war we decided to lose, because the Kings Freemasons wrote the constitution, Act of Independence that never was and set the US up as a crown (not royal) corporation and is that why a relatively new CIA has its officers sware an oath to the Crown??lol The poor Amerikan sheeple are really living and working in a Crown work camp anf now you might understand why Amerikans are probably the most isolated and narrow minded extreme thinkers on the planet
TrainSen	0	Awwww Harper is so cute, i feel sorry for victoria Beckham, they only print the picture's where she's not smiling because they have nothing else to print other than her frown, i dont blame her i think i'd frown if i was being followed around off paps all the time even tho it comes with the job it must get to ya.
TrainSen	0	school lunches suck the big one and are the most unhealthy choices available... who do they think they are to try to tell anyone they have healthier lunches at school??? our school lunches are so ridiculously high in fat and sodium... not to mention processed foods are the majority of what they serve. I would never let my child eat school provided lunches unless they did a major overhaul! 
TrainSen	1	Go away you orrible little cretin
TrainSen	0	Funny you mention Kobe and Rape LMAO <br>
TrainSen	0	@DougEngland I don't get it either. Florio just said something to the effect that it was very calculated that Manning went to local media first; nothing specific about why WK, but since he had him on his show that day, it might have just been flattery. It was on PFT Live yesterday -- it's on iTunes or the PFT site. (Since he interviews WK, you might be happier not watching!)
TrainSen	0	That's funny, don't care who ya are!

TrainSen	0	See, this is why it's a good idea to keep your religion to yourself. When you start expecting other people to believe as you believe, you look like an asshole. And we make fun of you. That's good for us, but not always for you

TrainSen	0	>A fully reserved Tyranid army built right can indeed exploit the current Internet meta lists. How? You make this claim several times but don't present any kind of strategy, evidence, or anything else. How are you "exploiting the meta"? How does the army deal with mechanized lists and mobile armies? >The long answer is yes but it will require near perfect play and some degree of luck. Why do you feel that a reserve army with perfect play/good luck can beat top tier lists, but other armies cannot? What makes it more effective in this regard? >I've also noticed that kill points are not often chosen as a primary objective at other events such as those that use the P/S/T format I can't speak for your experience, but most such events that I've seen have three objectives that are randomly allocated priority, making KP no more or less common than the others. Moreover, giving up KP is hardly the main disadvantage of the list; others rank much more significantly. > Note that roughly 75 percent of your army should arrive during the second turn :| Math, huh? >Many of the units in my army are fast due to fleet so I can quickly redeploy much of my army as the game progresses Fleet doesn't make you any faster than anything else. Other infantry can Run, and tanks are flat-out faster than you thanks to being able to move 12" automatically rather than hoping for a good roll. > Imperial Guard armies heavily rely upon their Chimeras to protect theirscoring units so you want to prioritize targeting their transports... Again, how do you actually kill transports? The lists you present usually feature very little AT. Your Zoanthropes and Trygon are the only units that will be able to consistently kill tanks. >At the end of the day though the results are the same\\xe2\\x80\\x94no major wins for Tyranids in fifth edition at any big events and I don't believe that is going to change while fifth edition is still in effect. Entirely true- at this point, I don't think that Tyranids are likely to take any major events, as too many factors are stacked against them. It's not impossible to win with them, but especially in environments where mech lists are common they will struggle. So do you really think that your own list is going to be able to achieve this- that you'll get "near perfect play and some luck" six or seven games in a row against other skilled generals to actually win a top spot?

TrainSen	0	Kevin: And Alessandra, being a pedophile is not a form of normal sexuality. Plenty of heterosexuals are pedophiles.pedophilia, like rape, is aboutpower not sex. ========================================================Kevin, look up the word sexuality, because if you think it does not relate to different sexual dynamics, you are completely mistaken about its meaning. Pedophilia is a deformed and dysfunctional kind of sexuality. Moreover, every sexuality and relationship dynamics involves power issues. You are just blind to this most basic fact that every human relationship has power issues at its core. It's obvious you come from a very mediocre public school to believe a stupid irrational statement such as your last one is actually smart ("pedophilia, like rape, is aboutpower not sex" ). Liberals like you just don't want to face how many sexually deformed people there are in society.

TrainSen	0	Ron Paul isn't looking to "win" the nomination.He is trying to get enough delegates so that he can gain a seat on and have some influence over the GOP platform committee.Like his supporters, he would like to see his budget plan adopted as the GOP budget plan.It will save $1 trillion in the first year alone and pay our debt off in less than a decade instead of the centuries the status quo parties want. He wants the NDAA repealed, which will return our 4th, 5th, and 10th Amendment rights to ALL Americans.He wants the failing unConstitutional departments and agencies phased out and the power of those agencies and departments returned to the states where they rightfully belong.Not only do those states already have duplicates of those departments\and agencies up and running, they had them before the feds ever stuck their noses into the\business the Constitution\clearly states belongs to the states, but the state run departments and agencies were not only successful, they are far cheaper to run.Ron Paul also believes that the number one job of the federal government is to provide the military protection\for common defense of all the states.He would like to see military pay raised so that a large section of the non-com\personnel don't fall in the category of qualifying for food stamps and welfare, but aren't allowed to receive it because they are "government personnel."He wants our weapons and technology brought up to and maintained as the best in the world.He believes that congress must DECLARE war before our military can be sent into harm's way, instead of having some idiot like odumbo go to the UN to get their blessing to blow billions on an unConstitutional w a r - Libya.He want the US out of the UN and the UN out of the US.The UN is more corrupt than Chicago politics and costs\American taxpayers even more.The\Un is the most anti American organization in the world.The billions of $$$'s\we send them every year go straight into the pockets of the corrupt diplomats and the dictators who send them to the UN.\\That is what Ron Paul is hoping to achieve with his candidacy.Why don't you do a little research on Ron Paul instead of swallowing the status quo parties' BS lies they've been spewing.\\

TrainSen	0	Our concern is the deception and lack of candidness. Accuser Larry Sinclair, challenged Obama to submit to a polygraph test. Barack H U S S E I N \Obama refused. What would happen if Barack H U S S E I N \Obama is gay and he is blck mailed? It could jepardise the security of the US!
TrainSen	0	Envy is not an American Value. I saw the article as well as others talking about obama's budget containing roughly $2 trillion dollars in new taxes and fees.It got methinking about how many billionaires we'd have rape to pay that - yes rape is the correct word; forcibly taking from people who'd legally earnedthe money they were still supposedly allowed by law to own. If we took every single copper penny from how many billionaires...how many would it take to come up with a total equivalent to the $2 trilliondollars.So I started adding up the wealth as reported in Forbes 400 "The Richest People in America".It's more than I counted. If we took every single penny of money from America's top 114 wealthiestAmericans, we would only make it up to $1 trillion dollars.That sounds like a very few number of people totaling a very large amount of money.But what if we doubled the number of billionaires to, say, 227?\That would only take the total to just under $1.3 trillion dollars (we're down to the just barely billionaires at that point). So I guess the point I'm trying to makes is if obama was able to redistribute the total wealth of the top 227 richest people in America, took every single penny they owned, it still would be almost a trillion dollars short of the amount of taxes and fees he is asking to levy onto "the richest people in America", those ugly "millionaires and billionaires".Folks, where do you think the other trillion is coming from? Envy is NOT an American Value.I would have loved to have been born into one of those rich families; or have come up with the neatest widgetcraze; or started a software revolution in my garage.But I didn't - and I hold no grudge against those who did. Those top 227 rich people didn't steal that money from me and I damned sure don't want it stolen from them under the guise of redistributing itfor the good of others.

People say that swearing suggests a limited vocabulary, I swear like a sailor on leave and I speak 9 languages with some degree of fluency, at least it's not a national scandal over someone saying 'bugger' or something pre-watershed. A good hefty expletive now and again on TV brightens it up

TrainSen	0	SADDAM WAS INSTALLED BY THE US. He was even encouraged to attack Iran, which lead to the 9 year long Iran-Iraq war which caused over 1.5 million deaths you lying sack of...!!!! And regardless of how much better the Shah was than today's regime it doesn't change the fact that he was a F'in dictator installed by the US and he was kept in charge by CIA trained secret service!! If it wasn't for US meddling Iran wouldn't even have an Islamic regime today. Like most other asinine things the US has ever done, their dictatorial plans backfired and caused the entire population of Iran to become hostile towards the US. And no one is regretting Mubarak's leave, only islamophobes like you do. As for the Taliban, the US government knew ***damn well how savage they were!!

TrainSen	0	It's an immutable fact of life that when politicians and their "civil" servants, who have never even run a lemonade stand, decide they "like" something that: 1. The alleged BENEFITS are grossly INFLATED 2. The alleged COSTS are grossly DEFLATED Because it's GREAT to spend other peoples money which is confiscated by an act of parliament.

TrainSen	0	I have never seen Mike so genuinely messed up before. Here, I'll bring closure: The core problem is that Prometheus does NOT bring any new or interesting ideas. However, it promises from the start that it 'will', but it obviously fucking doesn't. And that's where your current state of confusion stems from. Psychologically, you haven't left the theater yet, and are waiting for it to "finish". But you have (and will) in a few days come to grips with the fact that the movie is over, and that it was an empty, hollow piece of crap. And I just mentioned the core problem. I didn't even touch the nonsensical plot, the nonsensical characters, and so on.

TrainSen	0	It's pretty meaningful when it is the highest ranking government official, but there is no shortage of additional examples. Take a normal high school with an approximately 50% white and 50% black student body as an example. Go look in the lunch room. You will see whites and blacks sitting with their own much more often than not. Most serious conflicts will be divided along racial lines. Racial preferences are also reflected in where people choose to live. There is an affluent black community in my region because affluent blacks often choose to live among other affluent blacks. They should not be blamed for it. It is natural for people to want to associate with people who are like themselves. People's desire to associate with their own kind is not just a national trend. It is a characteristic of human nature which has existed for many thousands of years all over the earth.

Even Marilyn Manson admits to puking from nerves befor live shows when he was fresh on the scene...Bottom line is this:I heard the song, I liked it, I downloaded the rest of them and I love her style.fake lips and all, I think it works for her and like my boss said "She made it to your playlist, so..."
TrainSen	1	Apparently you are too stupid to even watch a video and get it right. For your desperately needed information, Reagan was interrupted27 seconds into his statement.

TrainSen	0	@Lost Ones @Old Man Game Don't get me wrong, I like THE Reggie Jackson, but just think if we had Maynor manning the second unit? Our starters get a lead, then the the second unit makes it grow. I think that will start to happen later in the year, but Jackson is getting his feet wet. Anyone else but me think Jackson plays a lot like RW did his rookie year? Out of control, super athletic and is able to use that athleticism to make up for being out of position sometimes.

Should he lose because he did not compromise his values, it says more about our country and Christianity in the west than it does Rick.

I paid in my 40, and then continued to pay every single month for the next28 years through military reserves payrolls, yet I will receive zero credit for any of that 28 years because it didn't quite reach the threshold of "substantial" contributions. So that was money down the drain. More accurately, some of it is going to you, while you spend your life whining about dedicated federal employees who get much less from the government trough than you do.

February 13, 2012 Dear President Obama, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to hear that the Obama family are doing well economically.Thats good.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how America is supposed to work.You worked hard.You sat in the church listened to every one of Reverend Writes sermons that attacked the nation that you are now the President of.Rose through the ranks of Chicago politics and still smell like a fresh bar of Irish Spring.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impressive.The wife got a nice cushy job.You got elected after you politically knocked off your opponent, he should be happy he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still breathing, then you made it all the way.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leaving out the sweet heart mortgage and the the whole Roland Burris/Blagoiavich thing because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all a little sordid, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not in the mood.It is Valentines day:) Is this the new American dream?Must be.But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how most Americans can access it?Where should one go to school to learn how to be a self hating rich person that pleas with the populace to raise their taxes only to avoid the appearance of wealth to forestal the masses from knocking down your door.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to think if I had money I would give a lot of it away to good people, and good causes.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to think that I would not be the person that would use that wealth unwisely and selfishly like you and Mr. Buffet do.You people selfishly convince others to use their money to obtain your political goals all the while claiming that your motives are pure.Really?How pure can ones motive be when they advocate for abortion and delving into the private relationship between Man and God?What ever happened to the separation of Church and State?Oh I forgot.Religion can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in the public square, unless your muslim, but government can infiltrate our churches and synagogues. Your motives are not pure at all.Recently the feds have even gone after fresh milk production.Even cows aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t safe from rich people like you and Mr. Buffet and Mr. Soros.What do you rich people have against milk?Are you afraid we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll riot if we run out of it?I wonder forty years from now we will not have to wonder why there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough milk.All we will need to do is look in the Smithsonian.There will be two heifers, stuffed, the plaque will read, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese cows were too productive!Nien!This must not happen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWill we one day have a museum with stuffed rich people too?We tried that it only leads to a nightmare.Money is like manure it is no good unless it is spread.When it is spread it tends to grow thing like grass for cows to eat, so they can make something called milk.Capital also creates businesses that hire employees that pay taxes and use their money to do things like take vacations and go on hunting trips with their friends.Regardless, if we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even speak up for the cows, who can we speak up for? :) Respectfully, Joe Doakes
TrainSen	0	Well, it will be hard for Iran to claim Israel is responsible for one of these attacks. The purpetrator blow himself up and was cooperative enough to bring his passport to prove he is Iranian. These countries, especially India should rethink their relationship with Iran and cooperate with the sanctions. Buying oil from a state that sponsors terrorism will only lead to more problems for all. It does prove to anyone objective person or nation who had any doubts previously that the Iranian Regime is engaged in lies and deception, both in their involvement in terrorism and concerning their Nuclear Program.

TrainSen	0	You are different, in a good way!
TrainSen	1	<STRONG><A>YOU ARE A MEAN SPIRITED AZZHOLE. POSTERS HAVE ASKED YOU TO STOP THIS!!!! NO WONDER EVERYONE ON THIS BLOG HATES YOU!
TrainSen	0	The collapse is now very near, i think! Hey EU people (and US people, by the way), let's just face it once and for all: We are bankrupt! This is jut too much debt. Everybody is drowning in a sea of...debt. Derivatives exceed, by far, the world GDP. Sorry...but it seems to me: game (soon) over!
TrainSen	0	Aren't you?
TrainSen	0	What woud he do...shoot him? Proud example indeed.
TrainSen	1	If I could find you..the correct term for your filty-h0m0 life would become...extinct.
TrainSen	0	Those who feel that this is a great joke have obviously never been the victims of rape, nor have they had mothers, sisters or daughters that are victims. I doubt if they had that they would find anything remotely funny about it. 
TrainSen	0	Wow Paul, fishin's cool, bass and flounder are two of my favorites I also like specs and perch! My day was full and fun later in the day. This mornin went to a early bible class memorial, and then to the cemetary visited Dad with some flowers and then we stopped at the San Jacinto monument and took the grandbabies on a tour through the refurbished Battleship Texas. They all wanted these dogtags and shell casings on a chain, go figure...and then came home and sparked up the Weber. Whew... made some fresh green beans made the girls snap all those and some potato salad and some fruit. Smoked brisket, and chicken, and of course some ribs. First thing on the news today was great. It's official, they say Texas is likely to have enough delegates to secure the nomination for Romney. Yahoooo!!!
TrainSen	0	Maybe they will change it tomorrow. I thought they might do it tonight but I guess not...
TrainSen	0	your wife is a loon,mick wont give her the attention she wants so she kicks off a bit like a a child who doesnt get their own way she likes to be the centre of attraction grow up
TrainSen	0	My mother-in-law is on the loose again. She loves wallabies!

TrainSen	1	you are retarded
TrainSen	0	Must be nice having umps on your team.
TrainSen	0	I love news such as this because it scares off all of the trolls. Even they will not try to defend something so blatantly wrong. Then again, logic doesn't apply for them so there will probably be one on here soon. Who do they think has an extra $20,000 sitting around to donate to them? We aren't all Soros. Why don't they suck his resources dry before they go after my pittance?

TrainSen	0	Panetta is kissing Obamas ass,he'll do what ever this loser President tells him to do,Obama is trying to destroy America,cutting back on defence is a good way to have our enemys attack us,he wants to save some money so he can spend it on radical programs he has dreamed up ,like forcing Catholics to go against their faith,and now he says it's over,no more debate,like he's the King of America and want he says is law,he thinks all Americans are stupid,he's the only one who knows how to\help us,but there's an election coming up and it looks bad for B.O.if the voters don't get this joker out of office we're doomed as a nation.
TrainSen	0	egypt will either have an Islamist or a high up from the last dictatorship as president, either way democracy won't last long
TrainSen	0	@Rourke needs to give me a fucking likeyou mean Polenta?
TrainSen	0	Then it's a duck, not a Fascist. Good thing liberals don't hunt, or the country would be run by Donald Duck while conservatives would be served up with gravy and potatoes. Assuming, of course, that these hyper-urbanized fops didn't pull an Elmer and wind up shooting their own beaks off.
TrainSen	1	Or a flaming queen like Gheyrooster!

TrainSen	0	Definition of WRESTLING stupidity...take the most gifted and technically sound female WRESTLER you have and make a joke of her in a backstage skit about farting. Am I the only person that thinks it's time for a mass firing in the Creative Team much like WWE does with their talent that aren't performing to expectations? If it happened 3 times a year with the staff like it does with the talent you can pretty much guarantee these guys would get their heads out of their asses and put better material on TV than this.
TrainSen	0	Oh Sally, take your medicine
TrainSen	1	fuck off, fucking pathetic bitch, too much to say for yourself.google it.
TrainSen	0	i'm directing this comment only to the my fellow chelsea supporters. i for once agree with AVB. I think he should be strict with these big name players. If you are manager of this team you need to be strict. Avram Grant was too soft. Scolari too soft. Ancelotti in his 2nd year too soft. Are they still our manager... no. By time we have a manager that does things his own way and not play to their tune. At least he can (if he is sacked) say he did things his way, unlike the other scared managers afraid to touch drogba, anelka, lampard and Terry. Too long have these "big personality" players rule Chelsea. Remember in the 3rd season of Jose's reign when we lost the league to untd, early that season Drogba wanted to leave as he was sulking most of the champions previous 2 years and after Jose left, he sulked even more causing lot of negativity in the camp. OH and remember the champs final the sent off AND ANELKA'S MISSED PENALTY????? then the next year Scolari became manager he sulked even more and caused again negativity in the team. my point is when he doesn't sulk we win things. Players like Drogba, Malouda, Anelka, Lampard and Terry get paid lots of money per week to be professional and to give their best. CLEARLY AND THEIR SHOULD BE NO ARGUAMENTS FROM CHELSEA SUPPORTERS WHEN I SAY NONE OF THESE PLAYERS THIS YEAR ARE PERFORMING WELL ENOUGH TO BE IN 1ST TEAM YET THEY ARE DEMANDING FIRST TEAM ACTION. MALOUDA IS A WAISTE OF TIME, MONEY AND A PLACE IN THE TEAM. If this was Sir Alex instead of AVB then Man untd fans would have supported him, i'm asking, can we not do the same with AVB. I'm a big fan of Jose, but i think AVB is perfect for Chelsea as soon as the older players leave in the summer we will see the true CHELSEA.. We are set to buy Willian, Hazard, Christensen and Neymar. Players such as Paizon coming through next season. IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING SQUAD FOR NEXT SEASON. TORRES - STURRIDGE- NEYMAR MATA - ESSIEN- ROMEU - RAMIREZ - PAIZON -MEIRELES - HAZARD WILLIAN COLE- CAHILL-TERRY-LUIZ-IVANOVIC CECH come on i know you are smiling as a chelsea fan and i know you are worried as a non chelsea fan. GO AVB!!!!!!
TrainSen	0	Get Gungnir and Growlanser: Wayfarer of Time and you'll be touching your PSP all summer.
TrainSen	0	@gdlow The fact that he was picked in the 7th round should have no bearing on the decision. He was stuck behind JaMarcus Russell for three years and his stock drop was strange to say the least. Irrelevant through, you have to look at the fact that he worked with one of the game's best QBs and best QB coaches for 4 years. Not to mention that Philbin knows how to make him succeed.
TrainSen	0	Other than the old USSR, is there really a more secretive government that that of the U. S.?
TrainSen	0	@MattWestcottfunny because Apple employees (me) are told to say OS TEN...not OS X like you are trying to elude to. in fact, OS "EX" is frowned upon in dialog. bitch harder about things you actually know about. oh and you're wrong about the Star Wars thing too.

TrainSen	1	Decapitate? The helmet hit him in the ass...where "your" head is!
TrainSen	1	You`re a sad excuse for a human being.
TrainSen	0	No. What's finally going to end this bullying bullshit is holding the parents financially responsible for the acts of their darling little miscreants.When they start laying&nbsp;whopping fines at the feet of the parents of the child doing the bullying, you'd better believe they'll be slamming the brakes on "little Johnny's" extracurricular activities faster than he can say the word Faggot.

TrainSen	1	he weak ass fuck
TrainSen	0	Campbell, I urge you to stop cutting. One little relapse does not mean that you failed. Put the razors in the trash and haul the trash out to the curb until it gets picked up. You are better than that. Please get the support you need and deserve from CT or whoever you are comfortable with. And know that you have support here and are welcome to email me privately any time if you want to discuss things less publicly. Get healthy and then get out of the house to do something that is productive so that you'll feel better and have more self-worth. Whether that is looking for another job, walking the dogs, going to lunch with someone or volunteering - getting out and doing something is a great way to free your mind in a healthy way.
TrainSen	0	What is the basis for your argument? It surely can't be solely the misplaced 'only'. Have your children had bad experiences in American Schools? I ask simply because you must be practically an expert on education in the United States in order to make your comments with such confidence.
TrainSen	0	The American commerce system runs on sex. It's used to sell everything from condoms to condominiums. You'd think, the party of Big Business, would recognize this and not try and kill the golden goose, (or choke the golden chicken, as it were.)
TrainSen	1	your a fucking toolbag. Why do you think there is a menu? So you can order what they fucking make, not so you can modify shit like some sort of royal prince creating your own masterpiece. Your not paying for the meal really, your paying for Darden INC. to pay me, to talk to your fuckin ugly ass. Your "meal" your eating is worth about 1/8 of what your paying for it. The rest is for the cooks and I having to deal with you. I just dont get why people think they have some sort of entitlement. Your a baboon, your eating at a fast food joint you chunky jerk! And I pissed on your salad! How you like them breadsticks
TrainSen	0	I know thanks for pulling them.

TrainSen	0	I'm longing for a secular humanist President.
TrainSen	0	Respectfully, I think you're wrong Alain. It is genetic. If physiological traits are determined by race, then what is so far-fetched about that notion that psychological/intelligence traits (IQ, future-time orientation, delayed gratification) are also genetically predetermined?

TrainSen	0	Wenger cos he only ever won a trophy with players he did not buy, when he had his own team (just the players he brought in) they have won an impressive ZERO trophies.

TrainSen	0	@MRL731 @ikathyv Totes.
TrainSen	0	Good write up, but don't you think the north caused this on all of us. They are the ones who's quick to rally round their own despite their evil hearts and devices. On monday, two muslims were sentenced to death by hanging for murdering a fellowmoslem, what all the Almajiris could comment is that Mustapha deserves not to die. Meaning: The Yoruba Muslim is not relevant as long as he is not Hausa-Fulani; those Mustapha killed are not relevant since they are not Hausa-Fulani even if they are Muslims. Please remind me - How many northern leader or elite has raised a voice against the despicable, divisive, corrupt and horrible governments of IBB and Abacha who broke Nigeria's virginity and destroyed her innocence? None, I suppose. As long as they are Hausa-Fulani, they can do no wrong! However, that is not to say I don't get some of your points. When Tambuwal and the easterners plotted against a Yoruba speaker ship and trampled on any idea of change in the senate leadership since it's still North/Easternerthing, GEJ never gave a hoot. 4geting so soon it was the Yorubas (Bakare and co) who protested and insisted that Jonathan be made acting president. He also forgot the Yoruba-man (Obasanjo) who took all bulletsinto his vests in other for him to emerge president against the power-deprived northern gluttons who would easily have devoured him. It's so convenient to forget, but we are waiting. Waiting... and I know it won't take long before even the easterners begin the 'marginalisation' song all over again. And then, we will re-tell the story.
TrainSen	0	"So we are saying the same thing? I'm just saying the wealthy can pay taxes, and at a higher marginal rate, that's all. It is redistribution of wealth, just as it is redistribution of wealth when you and I pay federal taxes in NH and NH gets less back than its residents pay in taxes,whereas poor righwing redneck southerners get more back than they pay in because they are less productive than us and less healthy than us." You want a FAIR tax system? Try my idea; A FLAT 18% income tax on individuals and corporations. NO DEDUCTIONS, LOOPHOLES, etc. INDIVIDUALS: Get a generous $10K personal exemption per taxpayer, and $5K per dependent. THATS IT! So fam. of 4, both parents work, $50K income, exempt $30K, pay 18% on remaining $20K, for a tax bill of $3,600 or an EFFECTIVE tax rate of 7.2% So fam. of 4, both parents work, $150K income, exempt $30K, pay 18% on remaining $120K, for a tax bill of $21,600 or an EFFECTIVE tax rate of 14.4% So fam. of 3, Dad only works, $1M income, exempt $20K, pay 18% on remaining $980K, for a tax bill of $176,400 or an EFFECTIVE tax rate of 17.64% CORPORATIONS: Pay 18% of net operating income. They get to exempt ONLY the direct costs of production. The best part is this plan is REVENUE NEUTRAL INCLUDING FICA TAXES!
TrainSen	1	Your Teabilly slutchild is just as ignorant as her mother. You people are the trailer trash of America.
TrainSen	0	You guys have an awesome slate of games this year as far as the whole smack talk thing will go. Aside from the divisional games, you get rematches against the Giants, Lions, and Saints. Plus the Packer/Niner game that never happened last year.

You could not turn on the TV or Radio without hearing her lies. Jerry Brown still smashed that corporate whore and sent her home crying.
TrainSen	0	damn vince you shit dont ever go right for you.
TrainSen	0	There is a very fine line between disliking someone and going out of your way to actively belittle and harass someone because you dislike them. You're allowed to dislike people, but if you dislike someone to the point of submitting disgusting confessions about them - i.e., saying you don't doubt they'd snort someone's semen - that's pretty fucking heinous, and makes you no better than the person you dislike. In any event, OP, you're not required to like everyone, and I don't think you should feel bad for disliking InRavenclaw. You should feel bad if you submit the kinds of confessions people have been submitting.
TrainSen	1	dick face u would do shit fake ass 
TrainSen	0	I love your new attitude and you're so right...we need to put ourselves and our health first just like we do with our children. So proud of you!!!
TrainSen	0	The battle cry of the believer is, "In God we trust".God is not of two minds, his marching orders are set out in the Bible.Yes, people are more "liberal" today than they were 20 years ago.My own personal odyssey from liberal to conservative goes against the tide and I believe things will get worse before they get better.I don't care what atheists think about me.Like the secular humanist today, I was completely naive about Islam until the Islamic revolution in Iran (1979) and reports began to filter down to the general public about the arrests, torture and execution of those on the left who supported the regime.There is only one Spirit of Truth.False prophets and religions deceive the people time-and-time again but I believe in the Jesus Christ of the Bible not man.Across America there are millions of people who believe in God and will not accept the foolish laws of man.Homosexuality, abortion, pornography are crimes.And the biggest criminal of all is the so-called president of the USA, Barack Hussein Obama.He is not a natural born citizen (Vattel's Law of Nations, 1758) because the Supreme Court has clearly defined a natural born citizen to be a citizen with two American parents.Therefore he is not eligible to be president - and the entire political and judicial system can ignore the truth but it does not matter to me.God bless America - and pass the ammunition.As Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death!"The liberal corporate elite that rules America is plain old fascism - the whore of Satan - but the faithful church is the bride of Christ.We shall never surrender!

TrainSen	0	Given the propaganda that could choke a seal these days, i wonder why this wasn't spun with the "toxic sugar" story that is sliming its way through the social psyche... Instead of ropes, we should gives these convicted killers unrestricted free access to the white stuff, that is, sugar. Given the propaganda, these lost souls will die protracted and painful, entirely avoidable deaths... seems like good enough punishment, if you're a propaganda cow, chewing on your propaganda cud. What is ACTUALLY happening is a series of unannounced and clandestine public polls most of which are probably commissioned in boiler rooms by our leaders-that-ought-to-actually-be. I'm sorry for your loss Boisvenu, truly sad... however, when a professional such as him can't separate emotion from logic and work from home, i question his fitness to do his job, irregardless of apologies or cognizance of his mistake. He is emotionally compromised and lacks the integrity (no fault of his own) to carry out the requirements of his position and he should be relieved of his duty and replaced by someone with integrity intact. To Harper and our other leaders-asleep-on-the-pot, DO YOUR JOBS AS PROFESSIONALS, NOT SCOUNDRELS. If you want to know how Canadians feel ask us, don't manipulate us and marginalize us. A time is FAST APPROACHING where Canadians will unite and tell their 'leaders' the quality of life and ethical standards in this country will not fall any lower, will not sink to new depths. We will collectively draw a line in the sand, and we will expect our leadership to listen... OR... we will rewrite THEIR laws to incarcerate THEM. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE; don't manipulate and hurt, or your actions will come home to roost.

TrainSen	0	To add this silly insult to injury and mask over it by calling for a debate on 'dignity at work in Parliament' with the undignified reputation these MPs have earned theirselves in recent past is hardly very fitting.

TrainSen	0	Sorry BM but as long as Rogers owns the Jays they're going to run this club on the cheap. That means nothing but bottom feeder payrolls in the $70 million range. Rogers makes billions but they won't put the money into this team to make it competative. That's just the way Rogers operates.
TrainSen	0	You are correct, one must purchase the mlb package, bummer.
TrainSen	0	If we glorified rapists and made them sound all heroic would it become a RIGHT to be who they are? That's how they were born. They didn't choose to be that way they just are so they should have the RIGHT to rape any man woman child or animal.

TrainSen	0	Aucausin, you are very pathetic hiding behind some Touchy Feely law that wasn't even a law a few years ago.

Guess what... we learned from it and knew right from wrong. Wealsolearned that there are serious consequences for wrong doing. So, show me where there is an attitude of people today that act as if they understand there areconsequencesfor wrong doing. You can't, everyonenowadaysfeel as if it's someone elses fault, or that they are entitled to do what they want. You sound like you are part of the problem and not part of the solution.

TrainSen	0	First of all the hero engine is STILL an x86 engine with huge graphical issues. Second, MMO's should not have so many large bugs, it was ok 10 years ago, but in modern games large bugs will kill it fast if a company expects people to continue paying a monthly fee for it. Third, the disclosure laws do not state where you must disclose that information, you will never see it in the actual article, only in places such as the stock holders information, typically released months after the article was published and rarely easily found by the general public. D, the game is incredibly linear and uses the same mechanics as any other MMO out there but with less graphics, less explorability and less fun, it is what one would expect from perhaps a single player kotor 3 with multiplayer options, not an "innovative" MMO, the same ol' same ol' is getting old and stale. Lastly, I am tired of people comparing this game to WoW vanilla launch, that was 10 years ago, you are supposed to learn from past mistakes not repeat them. Any "but when WoW was released" arguments are simply asinine points. All in all, the game is what one would of expected years ago, but not today. On a side note of how poorly they coded this game, it runs 2 .exe's for the same application, a huge no, no for video games because of the horrendous issues it causes, it simply looks like they cut corners and it is biting them on the butt now.
TrainSen	0	This will hurt the Rs more than help. To be sure.
TrainSen	0	You're a retard. You republicans yell about big government but at the same time want to ban gay marriage that doesn't effect you at all. Republicans are as big government as it gets. By the way, no one is saying you can marry kids, but, two consenting adults can.

TrainSen	0	Dick Cheney lied about Atta! Now this is NEWS! Actually most of this was confirmed a long time ago, and nearly everyone who read any of the books on Cheney knew. The only thing that is confirmed is that he intentionally lied and there is a paper trail that shows he intentionally lied. and this is why he should have been put under oath when they did the 9-11 investigation. Then we could get this bastard for perjury. Maybe this will keep him and his ignorant daughter off the television machine for a while but I seriously doubt it. These people have no fucking pride whatsoever! He'll probably be campaigning with Romney next week somewhere!

TrainSen	0	That's why the MORE non-whites we let in OUR country, the more voting/politics/best interests of OUR country get biased/put aside. No matter WHAT, non-whites (and whites like us) will ALWAYS utilize group think. Us VS. Them/Us. OR. Them. No matter what! We are screwed. People don't think about these problems when discussing demographic change. It's not black and white (no pun intended) like most people perceive it to be. Most people think it will go one of two ways, good, or very bad. There is VAST amounts of grey area. Very complex cause and effect deals.
TrainSen	0	"If this is true, it's hard to imagine that such a cavalier attitude towards a question like this one wouldn't have infuriated liberals and Democrats if it had been exhibited by George W.

TrainSen	0	For all the people saying "Well, thousands of people die everyday; suck it up, brat": yes, thousands of people die every day, but your mother passing only happens once in your lifetime.Yes, her family has money (I assume, but who really knows?), but having money doesn't mean you're equipped to deal with the sudden loss of a parent, especially when that loss leads the national news cycle for almost a week, and people are publicly airing your mother's and your family's dirty laundry. We don't know the life this young woman has had for the last 18 years, but it's safe to assume there were some rough patches; let's give her and her family some privacy in their time of mourning (I'm talking to you, media) and cut this kid some slack for not handling it well as we think we might.

You haven't had to live the life of a minority so pull your head out of your ass, get some REAL research-like maybe live like us minorities have to-and then go realize how good you have it, you white-ass rich kid bastard. And good job by the way, you threw some big words in there to make you sound intelligent, too bad your argument still sucks.
TrainSen	0	So you think Cigar Willie Clinton will help obongo win? Balack Obongo has learned his lesson too late. You cant trust a fuckingliberal. Just like you cant trust a liberal troll commenter.

TrainSen	1	I just checked and there are many races mixed in Spain. If she called herself Hispanic, then she has that in her blood. You are so arrogant of an online troll that you THINK you know about people you can't possibly know about. It's sickening.
TrainSen	1	That was the fuck of that lil cunts life ..goood job! !
TrainSen	0	Because the person is full of shit and has no one to talk to. Trying to stir shit. No one gives a shit about Perry anymore. He's in jail and on his way to prison where he will be squealing like a pig when Bubba gets a hold of him.
TrainSen	0	NO THEY AREN'T. ONLY YOU AND YOUR 5 NAMES
TrainSen	0	@NaturalBlues:disqus -- I used the cars from my train set as pretend rollerskates all the time. The worst accident though was when I tried to use them to go down the stairs in our apartment complex, not ride down a hill. I think that was an even worse idea than yours.
TrainSen	0	That second picture of him is not that appealing, but it cancels out with that first picture. I still want you in my bed Kibum
TrainSen	1	If I didn't know better, I'd have thought you were the one who wrote this piece of tripe, in a Sacramento publication no less. As for the career-long cheap-shot elbow-throwing adulterer, and accused rapist Saint Kobe boy, karma is a biatch, isn't it? It doesn't matter. Kobe-Dolt shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as Lebron. The man-child couldn't carry his sack. It's just something you, and other Faker fans can fantasize about. As for you, my tiny little Faker worm...it's time to crawl back down into your little hole. Your old girls are going down soon. You can bet on it. I am. Life is good.
TrainSen	1	Are you proud of your trolls?
TrainSen	0	It was an out, doesn't matter how sloppy
TrainSen	0	Yes. And HOW DARE YOU CALL ME "FOOL".
TrainSen	1	LMAO. Do people who hate gays and lesbians really think protesting will get us to stop having kids and being a family?? You serious?? Its funny how everyone quotes the bible but it also says DIVORCE is a sin, BEING A DRUNKARD is a sin, BEING A BASTARD is a sin, CHEATING IS A SIN. Have you idiots not read the 10 commandments?? Those are ALL ABOMINATIONS! You anti-gay homophobes are so ignorant. Karma is a bitch. You just wait and see, haters.

TrainSen	0	We need to Tax the 49% of Americans that don't pay any Federal income Tax, they suck on the teat of the real Tax payers, but don't contribute anything. OWS, Commies.
TrainSen	0	Heard there was some good high-level baseball talk over here. But after 100+ comments that read like bitter,bickering ex's, apparently not so much... Maybe another time.
TrainSen	0	Fucking hot man. Jeez, we look alike. Love the fur. Just wish you would share a pic of your dick.
TrainSen	1	What they would've edited it to say? You really love showing how ignorant and blatantly brainwashed you are don't you? Covgrats, now we all know how much of a loser you are, fstaff.
TrainSen	1	You're a fu cking idiot. You don't even know what the word 'smart' means.
TrainSen	1	Why did they interview you?Did you commit suicide?
TrainSen	0	So unfair again a young mother. I have doubts to me is suspicious as missed a party makes me wonder why?
TrainSen	0	When you <i>saw</i> him? Unless you saw him doing something gay (ie sex with another man, which would not only be very weird, I think it would clear up any confusion), I think that's kind of an assumption. Besides, why does his sexuality matter? It's not like it's going to affect you.
TrainSen	0	If it "had no nexus to his elected sheriff position", then why are they subjecting him to this witch hunt paid by the tax payers?
TrainSen	0	Chucklefuckers next door to Fuddruckers for a bite before the show.

TrainSen	0	I don't understand your comment. I don't know who Barack Hussein Kardashian is. US Congress and President are the Feds that I was referring to, so no, I didn't forget them. If you are implying that Obama is owned by corporate lobbyists...DUH.
TrainSen	0	What an incredible accidental tragedy. Condolences, of course, and prayers for all.

TrainSen	1	The child molester calling someone a racist, too funny! And then you make a gay slur, hilarious!
TrainSen	1	You are a traitor.
TrainSen	0	Yes they do. Our time is approaching.
TrainSen	0	EXACTLY WHY IS SHE A CELEB
TrainSen	1	And what happens when a bunch of religious fanatics defend a pedophile? Gee, sounds like the Catholic church! You are a disgusting piece of work.
TrainSen	1	If you think it's is so insignificant, why are you spending time commenting, unless you are a troll and can't help yourself. Get a life.
TrainSen	0	You are underestimating the East where actual defense resides. The Spurs are awesome, I would give them a shot, but if OKC won somehow the Heat would beat them.
TrainSen	0	Just those three...the others who beat up Rodney in California aren't any better.
TrainSen	0	Ten Reasons Why Gay Marriage is Wrong 01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs morechildren.07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours,the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

TrainSen	0	"I feel sorry for other grandparents that didnt have love and respect of their grandchildren." --------------------------------------- Hold it right there, grandma. Is a hug "love," or is it "respect"? A child can show you proper respect without hugging you. Your inability to discern the distinction between the two is what's holding you back from understanding this column.
TrainSen	0	It is an attack of their opinions, their twisted and idiotic opinions. Teach your children the word of God for it is not for you to damn them to the river of fire. Ignorance will not be an accepted excuse come judgement day. May God Bless you and open your eyes to his word.

TrainSen	0	@topharry123 could not agree with you more, these flowers will be gone in a few weeks however this lad chose to live his life that way and now it has ended and his family and friends have chosen this way to show their grief. No, most of us law abiding citizens don't agree (quite rightly) with his choice of profession or the way that it has been shown in his floral arrangements but come on this is HIS funeral and HIS family and friends so why can't they say what they want and don't want even if it is really distasteful.

TrainSen	1	Thank You! You just proved to everyone here that you possess an IQ of no higher than 20.
TrainSen	0	You don't appear to be familiar with the Obama campaign, which is a bit surprising.
TrainSen	0	It is bad! I can't even begin to reflect and do justice to how much damage this program has caused children- I was dealing with kids in and out of foster care- know of many who were abused, lots on drugs and alcohol now because of abuses- NO ONE CARES- give the fosters $ and close the door- if you have a working fire/smoke alarm and lock up your guns you are GOOD to go

TrainSen	0	A few Thunder fans here don't seem to want to acknowledge that they lost Game 1. All they seem to say is: It was on the road, so it's no big deal It was only 3 points, so it was no big deal Manu won't score like that again, so it was no big deal It was only one game, so it was no big deal Spurs fans are idiots, so it was no big deal Thunder will win Game 2, so it was no big deal Durant/Westbrook/Harden are awesome, so it was no big deal Tony Parker didn't score a lot of points, so it was no big deal The fact is, 75% of teams winning the first game of a 7 game series win the series. A playoff loss is a big deal. Period. There are plenty of games left, but making excuses is just a waste of time.

TrainSen	0	Were the people who were against civil rights as dumb and angry as the people who are against gay rights?Pretend for a moment that you put the Constitution and Bill of Rights as your highest documents when evaluating U.S. laws and policies. \How can you possibly contend that gay marriage is an issue at all?The only way that you can contend that this is a huge issue is if you put the Bible ahead of the Constitution and Bill of Rights--ignoring that this anti-tolerance thing isn't even universal across Christianity. So why again should religion be a leading factor in whether the legal and financial agreement that is marriage is allowed between two consenting adults, regardless of gender?

TrainSen	0	Why don't the citizens of Chicago that live in that area protect themselves? They can think Mayor Daley and the rest of the puking liberals for this type of violence. Yes, that is correct. The puking liberals have taken away the rights of the everyday citizen. If every law abiding citizen had the right to have a CCW then things would be different. I say, just go ahead and carry. It is better to be judged by 12 then be carried by 6. If a few of these punks would be shot by a citizen I believe the punks would think twice before attacking citizens. And don't tell me it happens in other cities. 49 states have CCW and they do not have these types of problems. Wake Up people and stop waiting for the police to protect you and protect yourself. Thank you

TrainSen	0	So I guess all the person had to do in the article was bitch constantly about a game that so many people have bitched about for ages and then they win the bitches over? Wow. As far as "Stop trivializing violence" goes. Why dont you stop sounding like a big ass c*** sucker and don't play games with violence then. I get so tired of all these holy sounding types that get touchy about video game violence. I've seen Blood Diamond a dozen times with the kids killing and getting killed and it doesn't even phase me one bit only because its not real, sure there is an emotional sense there but not enough to make me write to Hollywood saying gay sh*t like Stop trivializing violence because its disgusting. Why does a game have to tone it down when movies don't? I'm not defending COD in the slightest, and that's because I don't really care about the game. But when I read the headline of the article I was curious to see what others were going to say, but I knew hands down it was going to be an attempt to throw punches at a series that has sold a lot of copies already. All I can say is, it doesn't matter how "YOU" feel when every other gamer that plays the game probably can just deal with the game no matter if it changes or not. Sitting on your overgrown ass complaining about a game being this and being that just because you don't like it is stupid as hell. I hate JRPG games and why I also hate Anime with a passion because I can't stand cute crap, I hate that overly sensitive BS with the characters, I don't like Japanese music either unless its instrumental War drums or something out of Samurai Warriors or Kessen where it doesn't begin and end with a stupid Asian chick trying to sound like shes an innocent little annoying 11 or 13 year old...I hate high pitch whiny sounding voices too and no Japanese voice acting does not mean better over American voice acting because it still sucks regardless. But I don't go near the stuff (even though my brother plays JRPG games a lot, and that means I can't really escape it when we're both in the same room and I'm studying while he's just playing his sissy games). The fact still stands that I don't INTENTIONALLY go near things I hate just so I can whine about hating it like COD haters constantly go near Call of Duty to claim that they hate the game when its easier to just simply stay away from it, don't buy it, try to pretend like it doesn't even exist. I will not lie to anybody. I like violence in my games. People that walk around with a d*ck up there ass crying foul about CGI characters dying and getting hurt probably scream when the doctor comes at them with a needle. As far as Call of Duty having to change goes. Well, that depends on whether or not a lot of people want it to change, and not just the people that bash the game on a consistent basis either. I'm talking about people that really feel or believe it should change a few things and have accurate reasons why. Just simply saying "COD is for 13 year olds and needs to change this or that"...If anything the COD players are the ones that should change.

TrainSen	0	I am a sales arborist in the DC Metro area. I have grown all too accustomed to the status quo set by Service Magic. As a credentialed and educated professional in my field it has become quite disturbing to work with the environment that Service Magic has created, i.e. a false sense of qualification of vendors to the consumer. I have spoken with many arborists from other firms in our region and all say the same thing. This could have been a beneficial service, but without demanding proper insurance and credentials from its vendors it simply becomes a means for the unlicensed and uninsured vendors to gain business they are not qualified to perform. This also leaves the qualified professionals, such as myself, without a fair cost comparison to offer our clients. The fact of the matter is, companies pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for proper insurance, not to mention the cost of education to aquire proper credentials. Service Magic comes along and opens up an outlet for those who have not performed their due diligence in aquiring these necessary benchmarks to practice their craft to be solicited to the masses as "qualified vendors". It's a shame and has become a menace to the integrity of my profession and those of us who have worked hard and payed countless dollars to make ourselves a true qualified vendor. My hope is that the people at Service Magic make immediate change in their qualification of vendors.

TrainSen	0	My issue is not with the shoes. I don't care about them. If they invoke a certain response or emotion from someone it's not up to you or I to say someone should feel that emotion. WHo the heck are you. That's how Jesse feels. That's not how ALL black people and these comments demonstrate one of the reasons why race relations have a long way to go. There are too many ignorant people still breathing to have a serious dialogue about it. Stop telling everyone how they should feel and maybe just listen. No one told the majority of Americans not to have an emotional response to 911...despite the fact that they weren't impacted directly.Did anyone berate you about getting over your hurt? You understand how you can be moved in that instance..but other people are just crazy because they weren't a slave? You want to dictate how people talk...walk...dress...go the bathroom...etc.. There seems to be no limit. Adidas has every right to sell the shoe and people have every right to express how they feel about it. You know..the same way you express how you felt about 911.

TrainSen	0	To anyone bothering to evaluate Obama on his words and actions, vs. having someone else do the evaluation for them, he has never been anything but a pragmatic centrist. The problem with such a position is that the extreme left will claim a betrayal to an ideology never subscribed to, the extreme right has made it crystal clear that not only do they consider liberals sub-human criminals but they have no patience for moderates of any stripe, and the overwhelming majority of people who are in the middle are not political wonks and don't have the time necessary to try and figure out the truth through all the spin so they are unfortunately left with the impressions of whatever sensationalist press last got their attention.

TrainSen	0	A California bill mandating that public school textbooks be re-written to encourage 'gay,' lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) lifestyles passed the Senate Committee on Education Wednesday. Senate Bill 48, proposed by openly homosexual senator Mark Leno of San Francisco, passed the committee in a 6-3-1 vote. The bill would require that teachers and textbooks present alternate lifestyles in a positive light, with instruction in subjects such as history, psychology, political science, and communication in public school classrooms. The ten-member committee, comprised mainly of Democrats, unanimously favored the bill, backed by Equality California and the Gay Straight Alliance Network. Leave the kids alone. Don't indoctrinate them. Why is this in the schools?

How many times have you called other girls whores and prostitutes or made racist statements, but, of course, when you do it it's totally something else. May I remind you when you had to publicly apologize to Dawn Yang for the things you said about her and when you called women liars who were raped by a man which you deemed 'too good looking' to rape someone? Don't start your faux feminist shit when you don't have a fucking clue about what it means to respect women. You deserve all the backlash and more because, face it, you're an asshole.

TrainSen	0	Who cares though. This cannot be used as an excuse to treat someone as a lesser person. Would you want to ban marriage between men and women who are sterile? What about the fact that gay couples can raise children and increase the fitness of humans who are already alive? It's completely silly when one tries to use evolution as a way to justify why gay couples should be prevented from being treated equally.

TrainSen	0	Being gay is absolutely a choice - if it were not a choice, how do you explain the thousands of people who were in that lifestyle and have rejected it and become heterosexual?
TrainSen	0	The general population may be, but I think that the people in the NAR know exactly what is in there, and are advocating for it. These are the same people who think gays should be executed, atheists should have their citizenship revoked, and that the first amendment means you have the freedom to choose what type of Christian you want to be. They say they want to return us to a "Christian Nation" and that we need to base our laws on Old Testament Biblical Law. Go back and look at some of the stuff Bryan Fischer, Mike Huckabee, Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin have both said and endorsed. Look at some of the statements Rick Perry's advisers have made, and things Jim DeMint has said. They feel they have been commanded to take over government, the entertainment industry, the church, etc. \These people have more influence than they should, and enough to be dangerous. Their followers are probably naive when it comes to what their leaders are advocating and will continue to push their agenda without considering the consequences. Some of the Tea Party have tried to introduce legislation to pass personhood amendments (which are bad enough) but also to charge women with felony murder if they miscarry but are unable to prove they had nothing to do with it. I have no idea how they would go about autopsying an 8 week old fetus, but women would be guilty until proven innocent. Please see last part of post in regards to capital punishment. This is what DeMint and crew advocate. These people are dangerous, and over 45% of the House of Representatives either actively endorse, or are sympathetic, to these nuts: http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/02/evangelicals_an_1.htmlFor some fun reading, here are some links: "prenatal murder"\http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/02/26/georgia-lawmakers-anti-abortion-proposal-punish-women-miscarriages/ all sorts of craziness linked on this website:\http://www.rightwingwatch.org/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/14/dominionism-michele-bachmann-and-rick-perry-s-dangerous-religious-bond.html\http://www.theocracywatch.org/biblical_law2.htmhttp://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre1.htmlCapital PunishmentEpitomizing the Reconstructionist idea of Biblical "warfare" is the centrality of capital punishment under Biblical Law. Doctrinal leaders (notably Rushdoony, North, and Bahnsen) call for the death penalty for a wide range of crimes in addition to such contemporary capital crimes as rape, kidnapping, and murder. Death is also the punishment for apostasy (abandonment of the faith), heresy, blasphemy, witchcraft, astrology, adultery, "sodomy or homosexuality," incest, striking a parent, incorrigible juvenile delinquency, and, in the case of women, "unchastity before marriage."According to Gary North, women who have abortions should be publicly executed, "along with those who advised them to abort their children." Rushdoony concludes: "God's government prevails, and His alternatives are clear-cut: either men and nations obey His laws, or God invokes the death penalty against them." Reconstructionists insist that "the death penalty is the maximum, not necessarily the mandatory penalty." However, such judgments may depend less on Biblical Principles than on which faction gains power in the theocratic republic. The potential for bloodthirsty episodes on the order of the Salem witchcraft trials or the Spanish Inquisition is inadvertently revealed by Reconstructionist theologian Rev. Ray Sutton, who claims that the Reconstructed Biblical theocracies would be "happy" places, to which people would flock because "capital punishment is one of the best evangelistic tools of a society."The Biblically approved methods of execution include burning (at the stake for example), stoning, hanging, and "the sword." Gary North, the self-described economist of Reconstructionism, prefers stoning because, among other things, stones are cheap, plentiful, and convenient. Punishments for non-capital crimes generally involve whipping, restitution in the form of indentured servitude, or slavery. Prisons would likely be only temporary holding tanks, prior to imposition of the actual sentence."
TrainSen	0	lol, I like you Neil, but you know you just fucked up...right? Minho will not be defeated ;P
TrainSen	0	As usual do-gooders again propose to punish users, rather than\perps! STOP tobacco growers, processors, and sellers!Yeah,\we all know, 'prohibition' alone won't cure\the cost of addiction or healthcare!Law enforcement costs too much! Outlawing drugs doesn't stop stupid users or pushers! Legalizing drugs such as alcohol and tobacco encourages dependency, promotes deadly health problems AND encourages Liberal Democrats to steal our tax dollars to care for the suffering stupid AND to provide temporary\jail-time\for pushers! Declaring murder and rape as criminal acts\hasn't stopped either!If caught, capital punishment hasn't deterred either!Rules of morality and prayers hasn't deterred stupid behavior!Education has also proven useless! There is NO\sure solution to end stupid!God has\made it so and humankind loves gods!
TrainSen	0	Oh dear, now you will be sorry, in fact you will probably wish you had never been born. If you had smuggled it into the UK and were unlucky enough to get caught, you would have got a slapped wrist by one of our weak judges.

Like whining children who want it all but at no cost to themselves. "ooh boo hoo we have to pay doctors a decent wage and pension, boo hoo!"

TrainSen	0	You did your job, you redirected a KU basketball article on to football. Great job, as far as your earlier post, misery fools did start talking trash, I threw it back at them.

I do not post on misery articles, although I do read them on occasion. Have scanned the posts from their fan base, interesting bunch. Like a strange mixture of a Jim Jones home brew.

TrainSen	0	The Keynsian economiic imperatives are obvious to almost all economists and the vast majority of lay persons who have read an introduction to economics course. However, the plutocrats who make the decisions have material self-interests that are inconsistent with the general prosperity. For example, corporations owned by the plutocrats are acquiring foreclosed and distressed real estate all over the globe for small fractions of their former prices. Also, the corporate plutocrats are breaking the already fractured bones of organized labor everywhere from Wisconsin, to Canada to Greece. Sadly, the plutocrats and their authoritarian allies in the clergy have so successfully degraded public education that there now are hundreds of millions of devotedly ignorant and sanctimoniously stupid voters who sincerely believe it is more important to keep homosexuals from kissing than it is to feed the world's children. Democracy is dying all over the globe and soon we will revisit the desperately hate-driven politics of the 1920s and 1930s.

But this pisses me off because this was data I processed, it was circulated ages ago and she should have been looking at it then, not waiting until the last fucking minute before it goes out to find "issues". And calling the boss instead of sending out an email so everybody could have a clue what was going on? Well, the boss is going to hear about it when she gets back. This particular person always tries to pull shit when the boss is away.
TrainSen	0	Another example of a government gone nuts: "EPA's additional regulations will come at a cost. One conservative estimate is that gasoline prices will increase 6-9 cents more per gallon. In another outrageous example of an unreasonable regulation, the EPA fined refineries $6.8 million in 2011 alone for failing to blend cellulosic biofuel into gasoline and diesel. The only problem is that cellulosic biofuel isn't even commercially available, despite the government's mandate that we had to use 6.6 million gallons of it last year. Worse, EPA is mandating that refineries use 8.6 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol this year\u2014regardless of whether or a single drop of cellulosic ethanol is produced." http://cnsnews.com/blog/thomas-pyle/overzealous-epa-killing-refineries-hurting-american-consumers obama's regulators are killing jobs helter skelter! obama=WPE
TrainSen	1	Randal, regarding your first paragraph above, what articulett said! Regarding you second paragraph, you really don't see what you are forced to do here, do you? It's what I see you arguing on your blog and in our co-written book. You stretch things to suit what you believe. You use improbabilities to conclude a probability. You do this all of the time, almost in every case. Take my speculation that most non-believers, especially former Christians, have heard many of the things you say in this book, but most Christians have not considered the things I say in it. (that's how I meant the sentence per aritculett). First off, when it comes to FORMER CHRISTIANS we were scared to death to seriously doubt our faith. We were scared because of the threat of hell if we get it wrong. You probably do not understand this. When the time comes for you to seriously doubt your faith you will understand it. At that point you must be convinced your faith has almost no probability to it at all in order to reject it, since that is the point where Pascal's Wager has no more force on us. So we investigated it thoroughly, most of us. The more educated we are in our faith then the more we must investigate it. So it's more likely what you have said in our book will be things most former Christians have considered before. I have a mountain of anecdotal evidence for this as well. Almost every Christian I have spoken to always learns something from me and I have learned little or nothing from them. This scenario repeats itself every time I have a disunion with a Christian, and can be seen from the responses to my blog over a six and a half year period. I teach them. They do not teach me. When it comes to NON-BELIEVERS in general studies have shown that non-believers know more about the Bible than Christians. That's evidence, baby. The probability therefore that non-believers will not learn as much from you in our book is more likely, than otherwise. So these speculations of mine have evidence for them. Evidence. That's what I'm talking about, here, there, and in our co-written book. You must skirt it at almost every step in order to believe. And you provide some evidence that this is what you do here. You compared the probabilities of my speculations with predicting how many people will get rained on next February 18th. I did not say how many believers would learn more from me than you, nor did I speculate how many skeptics would not learn as much from you. I only speculated than MOST believers would learn more from me. Most, as defined as above 50%, minimally. You however compared my speculations with prediction of how many people would get rained on next February 18th. That's asking someone to specify a mathematical number of people who will get rained on. You are also asking for the impossible, or the near impossible, since no one can predict what the weather will be like on one part of the planet seven months from now (charitably assuming that's your comparison rather than asking someone to predict the number of people who will get rained on globally). w *ahem* there is absolutely NO comparative parity here at all. This is what I see you do all of the time. The unfortunate thing is that I have to spend 15-20 minutes explaining this to your deluded mind. That's a waste of your mind in my opinion, a waste of an otherwise bright mind who would never use it in like this in any other area of life except when it comes to your faith. Not only that, but I predict you are not done defending this utterly ignorant comparison. You do realize that I've stopped wasting so much time blogging because of Christan like you, correct? Your reasoning abilities when it comes to your faith is just that bad, sorry. I have no hopes of convincing you jsut as I have no hopes of convincing a leader in Scientology. You cannot be argued out of your faith because you were never reasoned into it in the first place. There is only hope for others.

TrainSen	0	Didn't take you any time at all to try to turn a solemn day into another attempt at racial conflict, did it? The Facts:The earliest known evidence ofDecoration Day observance goes back to various women's auxillary groups in the North and South, when ladies organized events to honor their war dead by decorating graves. The earliest recorded event took place on April 25, 1866 in Columbus, Mississippi when a group of women formed an association to decorate the graves of civil war soldiers, starting with those who died in the Battle of Shiloh.The towns of Macon, Georgia, Columbus, Georgia, and Richmond, Virginia all claim to be the birthplace of Decoration Day, having first celebrated it in 1866. The town of Boalsburg, Pennsylvania claims to have celebrated the first Decoration Day in 1868. Carbondale, Illinois claims to have celebrated it first on April 29, 1866. In all, some 25 cities claim to be the birthplace of Decoration Day, most of them in the South.To settle the dispute, President Lyndon Johnson issued a proclaimation in 1966 naming Waterloo, New York to be the official birthplace of Memorial Day.

TrainSen	0	Such a very weak response. How would the world function if you were in charge? "no its ok, Its not my problem\someone\just got robbed, they\didn't\hurt or\threaten\me." Do you not care about those who work hard? Im wondering if you yourself pay tax? And if you do, how you manage to stay so stoic when you think that those people do nothing all day and take YOUR tax money. Honestly write a book about it.My dislike of these people comes from the fact that many many people slave away to make much less and do not have the audacity to make such comments like\"I see eight people here having to choose between eating or heating." People make those decisions every day! Whilst not living off of others. And before they do that they ditch the booze and fags. There is a thing called principles and I think theirs and yours are lacking.

TrainSen	0	So the best thing to do to help fight addiction problems is to legalize?Not sure I get Tony's point. Although you can argue that some drugs be decriminalized for possession or use, those arguments fall flat when it comes to cocaine or prescription drugs.\You can blow your mind out on weed for days and just be in a stupor.Many prescription drugs are beneficial at so many milligrams per body weight, but deadly at twice the dose.Alcohol creates a myriad of variables when mixed with even Tylenol, let alone prescription drugs. Tony should have used this occasion to get people to donate to charities that help rehabilitate people. 
TrainSen	0	JoJo, You are absolutely inviting Obruny to get on my case again for using "we". But this is the kind of thinking I would put into a petition project, which, after all, are plural in nature. Here are my rough thoughts around "how to": I recommend we wait til we hear the [probably] disgusting outcome of the Security Council meeting today. Are they still meeting, or did they just go away, without bothering with any action? I have not heard that yet. We all first need to read the "how to" instructions to design a good petition. http://www.avaaz.org/en/petition/how_to_create_petition/ I have not read it yet. But it addresses logistic realities of petitions. We would need a bit of a discussion of what text we want. It has to be very cogent. You have seen my very roughly written theme.But maybe a much simplified call to boycott the Russian 2014 Olympics would be best.Consider how THAT could be publicized at the London Olympics by the British Syrians! Or a call to cancel the Russian Olympics altogether. That would go to the Olympic Committee, which is a dead end. They have no objections to tyrants. "They is one". But we would have to decide who we want to deliver the petition to, and that shapes the wording of the And it would be good to consult with a few other key people. We would not need to have unanimity, but we would need to know if "Syrian Campaigns" and others are thinking of doing the same thing. The situation now in Syria is such, so close to the tipping point, that every little project can help leverage the collapse of the regime.That is why I signed the petition to refer Assad to the ICC, even though I would prefer to simply lynch him in the streets of Damascus and display his body in every town of the land. Just my initial thoughts.Grammar pickers please note that I used the modal subjunctive "would" and "could", to indicate possibility, not fact.

Every part of my life is good and I am content with my academic achievement and success (academic and in life) so far. I will not justify how intelligent I am cos it is stupid to do so. People who are intelligent or smart never justify their ability cos their actions easily show their abilities. It is only idiots like you who feel insecure about themselves and they try to justify to others that they are smart. Your ill feelings about me being in the US cannot bar me from being successful in life. Sorry for who you are.

Because I think that what you have are swarming termites. I say that because a lot of people have your experience and they almost all think that they are flying ants. They aren't. They're termites. You should catch a few and compare them to what you find on the internet.
TrainSen	0	I'm in two minds over this.. On the one hand stats like this will immediately provoke cries of a widening class division between the educated rich an the uneducated poor. However in recent years the recognition of having a degree has been cheapened by the plethora of nonsense courses on offer. I think anyone who does now go to University will think a little more carefully over the subject they choose and perhaps will study that little bit harder to gain value for their money.

If you thinkI'mshowing off with any of my post it must mean you haven't done much with your own life. My posts are just a reflection of the truth to which you are obviously a green eyed monster.

How many gang bangers in jail have Pit Bulls waiting for them at home? It is certainly not a list of intelligent people anyhow.

TrainSen	0	@jsdavis13 True. You'd think that the Christians who are so hell bent into forcing religion into public life would be using it to do the things Jesus talked about. He never said a word about gays or when the soul enters the body. He spent all of his time hanging out with prostitutes and the poorest of the poor telling rich people it would be very hard for them to get into heaven. Remember the sermon about when I was hungry you did not feed me, because what you do for the least of these you also do unto me? I don't much think Jesus cares how we care for each other, as long as we do. A hungry kid doesn't care if dinner came from food stamps or from a loving donation. My guess is he would not think highly of a society that leaves issues like hunger and medical care to the whims of its donor class.

In this case, this particular writer and the comments do a similar deconstruction, yet he explicitly says "it's still fun tho" and people are still butthurt.

TrainSen	0	Not fair? He has tested positive for a banned performance enhancing drug. The investigation found no proof that it could have been meat. No cases have ever been found with Spanish meat nor other cyclists. He has a ban just like many others who have tested positive, in all sports, why should he be different. He should have taken the 1 year ban originally set, but no, Spain had to cover it up, and the president even got involved to get it overturned. Seems not just Contador wants to win at all costs, Spain too! Contador knew Schleck chain had come off, but broke the unwritten rule. He showed then he would prefer to win at all costs, no matter about morals.

TrainSen	0	I like the idea of charging gang members as members of a criminal syndicate. However, if all they do is lock up the leadership they just perpetuate the splintering that took place after the Feds did the same thing. That hasn't worked out so well.

TrainSen	0	Great ScottStephen F. HayesFebruary 20, 2012, Vol. 17, No. 22 Throughout the 2012 election cycle Republicans have pined for a bold, conservative reformer\\xe2\\x80\\x94a leader courageous enough to make difficult choices and articulate enough to explain them to a skeptical public. The good news is they have such a candidate. The less good news: Scott Walker isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t running for president. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running to hang on to his job as governor of Wisconsin. Walker is the target of a recall effort funded by national labor unions. Why? Reforms he made to balance the budget have dramatically diminished the influence of public employee unions. If not reversed, these reforms will inspire similar efforts across the country, and the outsized power of public sector unions will finally be reined in. The election in Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x94which will happen in late spring or summer\\xe2\\x80\\x94could have a profound impact on the 2012 presidential race, with the winning side emerging from the battle organized and energized in one of the most important swing states this November. Walker came to office in the Republican wave of 2010. He inherited a mess. Under his profligate predecessor, Jim Doyle, state government had operated almost as a slush fund for public employee unions. Giveaways to teachers and others put the state on an unsustainable fiscal path, so Doyle raised some taxes and threatened to raise others. He raided a state fund set up to cover medical liability, essentially stealing contributions doctors had made to the pooled account. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against that pilfering, but the money had already been spent. Even after budget gimmickry that would make Fannie and Freddie blush, the official deficit was $3.6 billion. Just over a year later, Walker and the Republicans in the state legislature have nearly eliminated the deficit. For the two-year budget cycle, the state will show a $143 million shortfall because the stagnant economy has resulted in lower tax receipts than had been projected. But the shortfall is for the first half of the cycle; Wisconsin will run a surplus in the current fiscal year. And Walker said last week that he will eliminate the remaining shortfall without raising taxes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a credible claim. He reduced the deficit without raising taxes. In fact, one of his first moves upon being sworn in was to cut taxes on businesses. His subsequent reforms have allowed property tax receipts to go down for the first time in years\\xe2\\x80\\x94by some $47 million. The recall vote Walker faces comes because of these results. The key to his success was his restructuring of health and retirement benefits for many state employees, asking them to contribute 5.8 percent of their salary to their pensions (up from 1 percent or less) and to pay 12.6 percent of their health insurance premiums (up from 6 percent or so). Even some of the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harshest critics acknowledged that such changes were reasonable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWalker is right about one thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Eugene Robinson, liberal columnist for the Washington Post. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen it comes to pensions and benefits, public workers in Wisconsin have a sweet deal. .\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x89.\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x89. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see why the average private-sector worker in Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x94probably paying upward of 25 percent toward health insurance costs and struggling to tuck away something, anything for retirement\\xe2\\x80\\x94might agree with Walker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Walker understood from his years as Milwaukee County Executive that such changes could not occur without dramatic reforms of collective bargaining for public employee unions. So he proposed them, and Republicans in the state legislature made them law. The reforms also ended compulsory union membership. The unions correctly understood these changes as a mortal threat. Without compulsory membership, unions would lose a major source of funds. And without the ability to bargain collectively for benefits, the unions would lose their most compelling argument to convince public employees to contribute a chunk of their income\\xe2\\x80\\x94in many cases more than $1,000 per year\\xe2\\x80\\x94for the privilege of membership. So they took to the streets in massive numbers and pressured the Democrats they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d elected to do everything possible to sabotage Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. Democrats in the state senate fled to Illinois. Protesters occupied the state capitol. The fight captured national attention for months in 2011. The unions lost that battle, but they did not give up the war. They launched an aggressive effort to recall several Republicans in the state senate with the hope of reversing the reforms before it became clear that they were working. They spent heavily\\xe2\\x80\\x94an estimated $30 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and lost again. Meanwhile, the results of the changes began coming in. In Milwaukee, the reforms saved some $11 million, an embarrassing windfall for Democratic mayor Tom Barrett, who had predicted that the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s structural deficit would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexplode.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Localities across the state have seen similar savings. There is no disputing the central fact of Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure as governor: His reforms are working. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge problem for the public employee unions as they try to convince Wisconsinites that the man responsible for this dramatic turnaround should be recalled. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focusing on two other issues: his 2010 campaign and an investigation into the activities of former Walker employees. Their first complaint is that Walker didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t campaign on the specific changes he would make to collective bargaining. Walker concedes that there is some truth to the claim. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t more specific, he says today, because he did not yet know exactly how he would make the changes to collective bargaining. But Walker is conceding too much. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide a point-by-point proposal to restrict collective bargaining, but it was no mystery that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make dramatic changes. Ryan Murray, a top policy adviser to Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2010 campaign, made that clear to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in describing the changes to public employee health and retirement benefits. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe way the proposal would work is we would take the choice out of the collective bargaining process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in comments published on August 29, 2010. Did that mean an end to collective bargaining over benefits? The reporter certainly seemed to think so. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Murray] said school districts often have some of the most expensive health benefits in Wisconsin and could receive cheaper insurance through the state if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to negotiate with unions about who would insure their members.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Christina Brey, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the leading teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 union, had the same understanding. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur members oppose taking away their rights to collective bargaining, so they would definitely raise their voices against it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 union, the American Federation of Teachers, distributed flyers to its members warning that Walker would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoid parts of labor contracts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94something that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen without changes to collective bargaining laws. In light of the success of Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reforms, complaining about what he said in 2010 seems unlikely to win many votes. So Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opponents want to change the subject. Last week, Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic party, toured the state in an attempt to link Walker more closely to an investigation of some of his former employees. Here again, Democrats have resorted to distorting reality in order to smear Walker. There are two separate issues. In the first, a woman who worked for Walker when he was Milwaukee County executive was found posting political comments on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website during working hours. She resigned in May 2010. The second involves two former Walker employees who allegedly stole money from a veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 organization that worked with the county on an event held at the Milwaukee County Zoo. John Chisholm, Milwaukee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s district attorney, has been investigating the claims for 20 months. There is no indication Walker knew about the employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 activities, much less condoned them. Chisholm has said that Walker is not a target of the investigation\\xe2\\x80\\x94which only exists because Walker requested it when he was presented with the facts. Some Wisconsin Republicans, pointing out that Chisholm is a Democrat and highlighting the steady stream of leaks coming from his office, are growing concerned that the investigation is a political witch hunt, designed to bloody the governor before voters cast their ballots. Walker, for his part, says that he believes Chisholm is an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prosecutor who will conduct a fair investigation. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably overly generous. The coming battle for Wisconsin will be a difficult fight for Republicans. Democrats have shown that they are willing to do just about anything to win. Unions are fighting this battle as if their very existence depends on a victory\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it might. For conservatives, the fight is about much more than one man in one state. A Walker defeat would send a message that political courage does not pay and political thuggery does. Walker doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to talk about the effect the past year has had on him and his family, but it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been pleasant. He has been subjected to numerous death threats. His wife, Tonette, has been verbally assaulted more times than she can count. His two teenaged boys have been targeted on Facebook. His modest home in Wauwatosa has been the site of several union protests. Last month, a protester outside Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s State of the State speech told State Senator John Kleefisch that his wife, Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cf\\xe2\\x80\\x94ing whore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Walker has been willing to endure these attacks to turn his state around and defend conservative principles. Conservatives should rally behind him.

TrainSen	0	...From: Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971) [CONTINUED] ... "There are at least intimations in the decided cases that a dual national constitutionally may be required to make an election. In Perkins v. Elg, 307 U. S. 325, 307 U. S. 329 (1939), the Court observed that a native-born citizen who had acquired dual nationality during minority through his parents' foreign naturalization abroad did not lose his United States citizenship "provided that, on attaining majority, he elects to retain that citizenship and to return to the United States to assume its duties." In Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. at 343 U. S. 734, the Court noted that a dual national, "under certain circumstances," can be deprived of his American citizenship through an Act of Congress. In Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U. S. 133, 344 U. S. 138 (1952), the Court took pains to observe that there was no statute in existence imposing an election upon that dual nationality litigant. These cases do not flatly say that a duty to elect may be constitutionally imposed. They surely indicate, however, that this is possible, and, in Mandoli, the holding was based on the very absence of a statute, and not on any theory of unconstitutionality. And all three of these cases concerned persons who were born here, that is, persons who possessed Fourteenth Amendment citizenship; they did not concern a person, such as plaintiff Bellei, whose claim to citizenship is wholly, and only, statutory."

He and his fellow would-be-dictators think they can trample our Constitution at will. He has tried as hard as he could to fulfill PC/Socialist agenda. However, God holds America and HIS sparrows in the palm of his hand. They need to check with fellow despots who have challenged America's resolve. They will be impeached! America will never be destroyed. America's enemies will destroy themselves, first e.g. With all the "supposedly" well placed bombs in India, etc. to blow Israeli diplomats to smithereens only MANAGED to "injure" a couple - as opposed to Israel's "absolute" success -if true- in blowing to smithereens any nuclear scientist(?) they target! When I hear Iran BS about closing the Straights, blah, blah, blah, I think of Saddam Hussein and his "mother of all wars" to be unleashed, if America even thought of attacking! American marines dug his rear end out of his gopher hole; I read somewhere that Saddam's head popped off t his hanging when trap door was sprung; to add insult to injury; pour salt in open wound: Petraeus set up US military compound in his mansion compound with all its gold leaf.

TrainSen	0	Let me give you a view from Brazil. Consenting adults, within the law can have any relationship they choose. Government cannot legislate morals. Captain Boycott, of the British Military occupying Ireland, with vast powers of the kingdom St his disposal, got rid of his wife of decades, to have a carnal relation ship to a very young lass, well. The community simply decided, to turn thier back when ever he appeared, close thier pubs, stores, once he pulled up. 'Shunned' Thus the word 'boycott' enter the english language. The point, if you feel that strongly, organize a society response to his films and other work, independent of it's intrinsic qualities. Here in Brazil, there is a culture of deflowering teens and preteen girls, by the nationals here, for foreigners they are sent to prison.This is often done by fathers and grandfathers, the patriarch of the family. Said to have originated in ancient Rome, the film BraveHearth made reference to first night, where the lord of the area do some form of this power sex on minors in thier dominion. West Virginia, comes to mind, as this power sex folklore is said to be in epidemic proportions, these daughters get deflowered in house, first, sound familia. Are you going to 'boycitt' the state of West Virginia? Clearly Morgan has crossed the lines, of our sensibilities, our Puritan morals, and our expectation of decency, so did George W. Bush, with his Hurricane Catrina etc., and Bill Clinton with his oval office dick sucking, episode of his intern.These are/were actual Presidents of these united States. Do you have the right to impose your morals on consenting adults within the law? We all have the answer to this? What freekie things are you doing? Can you state, as I am now, none!job

TrainSen	0	Mary, I appreciate your manners and encouraging your classmates to follow. I also think it's important for professors to realize that students often have back-to-back classes. I certainly know what it's like to "get on a roll" and want to finish whatever I'm lecturing about. However, I'm also unforgiving when students are late to my classes. When I wrote about Things Professors Do that Irritate Students ( http://www.profkrg.com/things-professors-do-that-irritate-students), keeping students late was one of the main things students mentioned. Quite simply, one professor's self importance often leads to students being penalized in other classes. I would hope that, when I go over in class, a student would respectfully make me aware of the time. Thanks for your perspective! Kenna
TrainSen	0	Looks like Obama is going to get the US another credit downgrade for borrowing and spending and failing to come up with a credible plan for tackling the debt.Credible is the operative word. Obama can blow smoke up the publics skirt all he want to but the S&P and other credit agencies are not going to be fooled in the least. They've already warned of another downgrade and why? Because they don't see ANY real progress being made on Obama's part to intellegently and pragmatically address the issue in a published\plan. And, the reason they haven't is because the president has no interest in cutting spending as long as he can borrow from China, et.al. The only way out of this mess is with private business growth and if anything can be said of the last\3.5 years it's that if Obama is really really good at anything it's squashing growth. So, either we\choose austerity and growth this election or we reelect Obama and face it in bankruptcy. What's going to happen to\defense and\social security and\medicare and medicaid and all the social nets\when Obama\can't borrow the money to pay for them? That's what this election is about and that is the only question\that needs an honest answer.

TrainSen	0	I think you're making a fairly common mistake in assuming anyone who doesn't vote Conservative is "progressive". Most of the Labour heartland up here in the North is deeply conservative in attitudes towards benefits, immigration, Europe and many other things, but the Tory Party are badly damaged goods here. Labour just put the frighteners on the voters by saying "vote for us or the Tories get in again". If the Tory party implodes and is no longer there to be used as a threat, Labour will not last much longer.
TrainSen	0	@jjdjjd @raygillies550 Again, are you against abortions in the case of rape and incest? In the case of the mother's health? In the case of the fetus not being viable? If not, how many of those 340,000 were those sort of cases?

TrainSen	0	Definitely the number of questions asked drives engagement, It is not easy to have what appears to be direct access to one of the world's most famous newspapers. Plus they ask questions that are extremely relevant to the moment. And some of their content is behind a pay wall so this feels like "free access"

TrainSen	0	And your point is that the heterosexuals have brought in a peaceful, loving and beautiful world? Read the news. Heterosexuals have brought the world to the brink of destruction. Your logic is off. What is there to "consider, or think deeply on" when a homosexual is born this way. When did you think and consider deeply about becoming a heterosexual (if you are) and then stand on the mountaintop to tell the rest of us how it's done? To drill into gays and lesbians that they are sick and perverted and shame them to death is a one way ticket to a Muslim country with Sharia law. You can pack your bags and go anytime. Get used the new world. It's not going away... unless the heterosexuals destroy it sooner than later.

TrainSen	0	The GOP just can't help themselves. \The only way I see them having their nominee elected is focus on the economy. I think it's doing better, and stats show it is but that's the underbelly of Obama. Instead, the GOP is focused on a "pure" candidate and bringing issues such as contraception into the discussion is a dead bang loser for the GOP, but by all means continue to tell women you know best.

TrainSen	0	You fail miserably in thwarting logic. Ever hear of the "rule of law" in your obviously pathetic educational backround? Idiots like you make blogs fun to laugh at, but you have no place in society as anything other than a clown. How many commendations from Congress or Presidential administrations? Zero.

TrainSen	0	\A simple, history based warning for the Liberals out there.IF you willtake a little time to review history, real history, not the revised versions that are, and have become so very popular today, you will find that gays have been persecuted worldwide ever since the Fall of Rome. The radical elements, socialists, Marxists, and Communists encourage the gay movement to indirectly help them become more powerful.Once in control, things will change very dramatically as history clearly shows.What happened to gays in Germany, China. and Russia? What is happening right now to gays in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.The so called hate gays say they get from the Right will one day seem like a little teasing compared to what waits for them if this Republic does not survive.We the People are (All of us) on a very dangerous path.The current Administration must be defeated at all cost in November. Our very Liberty requires nothing less!

TrainSen	0	you are really a great woman and mother. God will continue to bless you and your family.
TrainSen	0	Additional thoughts based on other people's info: 1. I kind of agree with the being a SmackDown star thought though eventually I think Bryan should have a legit shot at the title. Maybe just blatantly move him to Raw, so he can. And please don't mention Tensai. The guy is not ready to challenge Punk for the title and hopefully never will be, 2. Ew, Big Show? Even when I used to despise Show for his booking, I would never say ew. Seriously, who says that? 3. None of you guys really pointed out the fact that this is only falling in line for Jericho. He won't come back immediately. He is touring with Fozzy now and will be gone a lot of the summer. The only one who is hurt is Orton who we get to right afterwards. 4. Wait, why are we talking about two newcomers getting their very first PPV match against the face of SmackDown? Sandow and Cesaro are not at a point that they should be wrestling against Orton. Miz would be a good choice if he weren't falling so far and so fast lately. I stand by Ziggler or Judas' idea of having Orton be the special guest referee. 5. Raw had at least the Punk/Bryan segment. Also, when you say there is no tag team division, you seem to miss the fact that the division is in full rebuild right now. Everyone from the Usos to Darren Young and Titus O'Neil to Hawkins and Reks to the AW stable is stepping up and finding a place. In fact, the least fluid team right now might be the champions who still don't feel like a real tag team or a serious threat. As far as SmackDown vs. Impact, I agreed with the guys on Impact, but you guys are sometimes underscoring SmackDown which was very solid story-wise and especially wrestling-wise. 6. Yeah, obvious the TNA move was positive while the Raw move is polarizing. 7. Wow, a lot of Hogan lovers. "He made the show better." "Best mic work of his career." What? Hogan was great on the mic in the 80s and 90s. He has not improved. He has lost his wits and charisma for the most part. Laurinaitis plays his role to perfection, and he brought about the great Extreme Rules PPV. He is a long term storyline, taking over the company one step at a time. Hogan has not improved programming. The creative team has just come up with a couple good ideas since Hogan arrived. Sorry, but at least Laurinaitis doesn't have an easy replacement. 8. Btw, Sean, you aren't ahead of me anymore. I went for a perfect 20 at Over the Limit putting me in clear first. Second, I see some of your points, and Shelley could work. I just think Morgan has to be the choice now. It could end up being wrong, but Shelley is a much less safe and much more long term choice. 9. I stick by what I said. Sting shouldn't be wrestling any more. He doesn't have the skill or the presence he once had. He is just a symbol being hopelessly dragged around by TNA desperately. 10. Wait, so no Angle then? Then it will probably be Sting. If not, people need to realize that Roode has feuded with Hardy already. He has feuded with Styles already. Basically, that means it is someone fresh like Austin Aries or Samoa Joe. Or it's Anderson who has been built to it. So I guess I'll say I hope it's Anderson over Sting, but it will probably be Sting.

TrainSen	0	"Let adults make their own decisions, just as long as they are not directly hurting or endangering others." Your words. Nothing was put in your mouth other than the crap that came out of it. "I'm not sure any rider is expecting society to pick up the tab" That's the point. They don't bother to even consider that their choices have significant impacts on others. Those who demand complete freedom are completely selfish. And, for those who are also as blind as you, rather than "jumping on the first comment you saw", I posted 40 previous comments, often undermining either the facts or the logic of other libertine fools like yourself.

TrainSen	0	Hodgson was obviously rattled by the uproar about Ferdinand (which is a nonsense really), that he went and filled more than half the team with black players to prove that he's not a racist! He definitely went over the top! Ashley Cole, Joleon Lescott, Defoe: Definitely YES. But Oxlade-Chamberlain, and out of form Walcott?? Young didn't do much either! If you're going to manage a team, block out all the noise from the outside (Ferdinand) and get on with the job. It's either that or risk England going out in this preliminary stage \u2014 and then the shyte will really hit the fan... (or, rather, the fans will hit you with shyte)!

TrainSen	0	She is as irrelevant as Bush, Sarkozy and the other practioners and adherents of this conservative austerity bullshit. Obama better get his finger up and learn which the wind is blowing, because he is about half austere himself. This shit has had its day and people now know it was all a manufactured solution that was counter-intuitive from the beginning and it was sold to frightened people by snake oil salespeople. It is great to see that people all over the world are finally waking up and rejecting this shit once and for all; except for those ignorant followers of that fear monger extraordinaire Wrong Paul\xae\u2122! The Vons were educated idiots who fooled a lot of people from Europe to America for a long time! When this Austrian School economic scourge is wiped from the face of the earth I will be a happy man!

I found that, at that time, there were enough nuclear weapons on Earth to detonate one each second for thirteen hours ... and more (I no longer remember the exact amount of time.) We had enough nuclear weapons to detonate one every second of every minute for over thirteen hours. It was about then that I became clear what "insanity" was.

TrainSen	0	1) This is a sham to begin with, because there is no law in existence which keeps homosexual people from spending their lives together in anyway they see fit -- this is a manufactured "injustice" in attempt to force people to call them "normal".2) To answer your question directly, once you blur the lines to make one group of people feel better about themselves ( pretend that men "marrying" men or women "marrying" women is normal ), then who is the next group waiting for their chance to blur the lines further? The question really becomes, why have any lines at all?What is marriage after all?"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh."Genesis 2:24Whether you regard the Bible as a moral authority, it does show that the concept of marriage was between a man and a woman as far back as at least 6000 years -- I think that makes it fairly well established. There are a lot of people in the world who desire evil -- people who want to live their lives pursuing "feeling good" -- these people use drugs, child molestation, rape -- anything that makes them feel good for the moment.How is that different from homosexuality?This is something that is clearly not by design, yet it makes you feel good -- so do you do what's right or do you do what makes you feel good?In your pursuit of doing what makes you feel good rather than what is right, you do it long enough, and then you say that guilty feeling is because of other people and that you need to force them to change because after all, it's totally normal that you are doing what you are doing ( rationalization ). You may not believe in an ultimate authority, but what happens when you have helped convert the whole world to your way of thinking -- reduced any shred of morality to the lowest common denominator?When all of us are free to pursue whatever lust happens to pop into our hearts when we wake up in the morning?It's already happening now really -- schools are pushing harder and harder for younger and younger kids to be "instructed" in every last detail of the most pornographic forms of sex -- desensitizing the nation.Why?
TrainSen	0	I don't know why you lot are complaining about Mr. Barroso. Of course he is unelected, he is a Communist Commissar for God's sake. They are appointed not elected by the people, because that's not howthe true democracy of the workers works. Just work hard, pay your taxes, then give them to him, through HMRC and the Lib Dems,to spend as he sees fit. Don't worry, Communist Commissars do not make mistakes, he WILL spend your hard earned cash very carefully. Don't you know how lucky you are to have him. And another thing, also be thankful for that other Commissar, Comrade Rumpy Pumpy, and please don'tdescribe him as a cross between ET and a lettuce leaf, otherwise its the Gulag Correction Centre for you.

I think he is definitely all dawg and I can't blame him for feeling blessed to receive a scholarship offer from the reigning national champs as a junior in high school. I am a huge UGA fan, and even I would be pretty proud of that.

The bottom line... Teachers arealways getting fucked by political promises... and as a result of the total disrespect... they are lashing out in all types of unusual behavior. If you hear a politician in 2012 throw around more bullshit on how he's going to make life better for Teachers... do the Teachers a favor... DON'T vote for them.

Because there are laws on the books, that Congress has passed \u2014 and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know we've got three branches of government. Congress passes the laws. The Executive branch's job is to enforce and implement the laws, and then the Judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system, that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president.'-Barack Obama 2011

TrainSen	0	From: Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971)(a case involving statutory citizenship forfeiture, discussing dual citizenship/dual allegiance): "The Congress has an appropriate concern with problems attendant on dual nationality. Savornan v. United States, 338 U. S. 491, 338 U. S. 500 (1950); N. Bar-Yaacov, Dual Nationality xi and 4 (1961). These problems are particularly acute when it is the father who is the child's alien parent and the father chooses to have his family reside in the country of his own nationality. The child is reared, at best, in an atmosphere of divided loyalty. We cannot say that a concern that the child's own primary allegiance is to the country of his birth and of his father's allegiance is either misplaced or arbitrary. The duality also creates problems for the governments involved. MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN recognized this when, concurring in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 372 U. S. 187 (1963), a case concerning native-born citizens, he observed: "We have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance. . . ." In a famous case, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote of the problem of dual citizenship. Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717, 343 U. S. 723-736 (1952). He noted that "[o]ne who has a dual nationality will be subject to claims from both nations, claims which at times may be competing or conflicting," id. at 343 U. S. 733; that one with dual nationality cannot turn that status "into a fair-weather citizenship," id. at 343 U. S. 736; and that "[c]ircumstances may compel one who has a dual nationality to do acts which otherwise would not be compatible with the obligations of American citizenship," ibid. ... [CONTINUING]

TrainSen	0	Is that what you say when one of your own family members dies?
TrainSen	0	I agree that parents are harming their kids with the sugar and processed food and factory-farmed animal products they feed them. HOWEVER, the USDA has a long history of CAUSING THOSE PROBLEMS, not ending them. I think this practice is foul and untrustworthy, like all government/police-state practices this country is adopting. And yet yes, parents need to wake up and step up their game if they want their kids to outlive them...since this is the first generation that isn't expected to. And that is in large part due to diet and lifestyle, two things parents have 100% control over. So when I see parents get in an uproar over their right to feed their kids GARBAGE, because that lunch technically is NOT healthy,it is really sad and I feel sorry for the kids. Not trying to be an ass here, but nobody likes the truth...

TrainSen	0	The fact that against Spurs, Balotelli should have got a red card for stamping, and Lescott for a forearm smash, doesn't alter the fact that against Liverpool, City were robbed. They didn't get a penalty they should have got. And had a penalty given against them that was never a penalty. I'd have been pig sick if that had happened to Arsenal. 
TrainSen	1	You want a smack on the back of your head punk?
TrainSen	0	That is totally correct. Hitler could never have done what he did without the approvel of most of most Germans.
TrainSen	0	Damnnnnnn, That shit was epic!!!! What the fuck!!! Wow, keep shreading bro soon you'll be chilling with the big boys. Bmx 4 life nigga!
TrainSen	0	LeBron, no matter who says what, you are an incredible player and teammate. You have played your heart out and we can all see that. I know that you really don't care what he said, but just letting you know, you and the rest of the team make me proud.
TrainSen	0	@SlipResistantShoes@DoobyDoobyDoo@Adam12 Also this douchebag has been claiming that all these boys are co-conspiring tho get cash the whole time. How can you even freaking say that to victims of sexual abuse. makes me want to punch him.
TrainSen	0	I agree with most of what you say, but how do you figure we the people allow it?We have laws and punishment inplace. No one is more despised than a child killer.
TrainSen	0	Big blunder... I'll take any of them over that ugly dude Rachel madcow any day! And they are 10x smarter than her.
TrainSen	0	@darzinWell you click your mouse binds, you don't manually use your mouse to click 1 - 10.
TrainSen	1	Kurius, you said everything that needed to be said here. I will still add that Charles you are a pretentious toolbox for thinking your opinions are remotely viable. Scooby...you moron, DJ's are musicians because they make music. Just because they don't play an instrument and you don't like the music they produce doesn't mean a damn thing. Charles and Scooby...You Fail!
TrainSen	0	The problem would go away if we legalized marijuana. Nobody listens.
TrainSen	0	And another benefit to counseling is that you don't lose all your friends because you drove them crazy with your constant neediness.
TrainSen	1	YOU SHUT YOUR FUCKlNG MOUTH YOU DlRTY WHORlNG DRUNK BlTCH
TrainSen	0	The Christian church repelled the Islamic conquest of Europe about a thousand years ago, but the secular system in Europe right now has opened the door for the Islamization of Europe. Muslims in Europe have a birth rate more than 4 times higher than native Europeans so it's only a matter of time.
TrainSen	0	you are an idiot if you think he really raped her...he's KOBE BRYANT! Thats like accusing Bill Gates of asking for a loan.
TrainSen	1	I swear I hate when U fresh off the boarder wetback crooked eyebrow short hairy mexicans come on our site and bash on us!!! I CANT WAIT UNTIL A REPUBLICAN IS ELECTED SO THEY CAN SHIP U FUCKIN WETBACKS RIGHT BACK TO MEXICO AND CUBA!
TrainSen	0	I am over the limit as prescribed by the law...
TrainSen	0	if u gotta still trash talk phi phi o'hara ur pathetic, truly
TrainSen	1	Ever eat AIDS infected feces? Just eat your own and you will..
TrainSen	1	So you call any teen who gets pregnant a "dumb bitch"? That's freakin dumb. You know, it happens sometimes. Yeah, try getting out from behind your computer screen and saying that to someone's face, you pussy. I can't get enough of you "compassionate, loving, selfless, kind, looking-out-for-your-fellow-man" libs. You just love to call everybody who disagrees with you "bigoted," and you don't realize what a polluted soul you have.
TrainSen	0	Sungjong you are just soooo like a man now. Infinite bias list messed up once again.
TrainSen	0	Fucking apple fanboys
TrainSen	0	So, what will you have to say when Obama loses?
TrainSen	1	Are you still around sicko? You're the jackass who abandoned your best friend who came out as gay. Nice.
TrainSen	0	No, you are wrong.
TrainSen	1	Funny you on here talking about the soulful ghetto black people but you on a black site that markets to the ghetto. You know you wish you were black. And if you are black you are a sellout nigga lol. You are just an actor. On here to create arguments and division. I see through fools like you. You came here to play a role. Keep playing it because soon its gonna end. Good day.
TrainSen	0	@echo1 - yeah, don't forget Rev. Wright got $150k to keep his mouth shut in 2008. Mother's milk indeed.
TrainSen	0	At least you are, and thats for sure. :o)
TrainSen	0	I recently just watched the documentary Such Hawks Such Hounds and holy god damn sunnuva bitch are there a whole lot of bands I need to start listening to. I have no idea how I've gone this long without listening to Sir Lord Baltimore.
TrainSen	0	You're a lucky man to have such a clever wife.

TrainSen	0	Oh dear, now you will be sorry, in fact you will probably wish you had never been born. If you had smuggled it into the UK and were unlucky enough to get caught, you would have got a slapped wrist by one of our weak judges. Asia is different, drugs are not tolerated, there are NO human rights, sentences are long, prisons are real prisons not like the UK world famous holiday camps!!
TrainSen	0	I never said "what works for the baby." I said what works for the mother in terms of her health conditions. And her ability to labor and deliver safely.No one wants to kill babies or mothers. Not ever careless Obs.
TrainSen	0	Nuclear fallout causes cancer. I don't see them trying to prevent it.
TrainSen	0	are you still here?
TrainSen	0	National Post = National Inquirer
TrainSen	1	gungongoon, you make Britain what it is today, full of cretinous maggots such as yourself. If you cant say anything intelligent why dont you just keep your big fat mouth shut.
TrainSen	0	If the Dems want to keep their asses in office then they best toe the line and protect Unions damnit!
TrainSen	1	You should man-the-fuck-up and read the God-dammned books. Then whenever someone brings this shit up you can say "well, I don't watch much TV, but in the <i>book</i>..."
TrainSen	0	con il mio nokia rifutavo le chiamate a rutti
TrainSen	1	You all suck, like hungry hookers.
TrainSen	0	Love another?.. But don't love another more than we love our gawd, or else he'll throw us to hell for all eternity - as jesus says in the bible, multiple times. But don't love gay people. Kill them. Kill them all. Kill all nonbelievers as well. And witches. And servants of other gods. Disobeying children? Must be slaughtered. Children who call our prophets bald? Must be torn apart by bears sent by god. Adulterers? Pfft, them too. And so on, ad infinitum. Kill everyone. Except the mindless zealots. Please. The intellectual inconsistency you demonstrate here makes me dizzy. It was SECULARISM and HUMANIST IDEAS that pulled our little society out from the muck of religious people - like you, and worse. Don't you dare to tell me, or any other human being that we were born faulty, sinful, worthless.
TrainSen	0	weapons??? what planet are you on???
TrainSen	0	Yet another "Straight to DVD" cliche Gangster film no doubt. Starring, 1 trick pony Danny Dyer and drinking pal Tamer Hassan. Seriously? what fool finances these films? Steer well clear Mr Wright if you actually want to make something of yourself on the big screen.
TrainSen	0	dropped the ball? did they not just lower all their previous models by $100 as well as refresh them with intels latest architecture?
TrainSen	1	You are a fool and do not understand the flattening of the world.
TrainSen	0	If not news worthy, why are you posting here?
TrainSen	0	@Karla OMG! I wish I could say I hadn't gone through it, but I have. I once dated a guy who had lost his job. His fiance had broken up with him because she didn't want to marry an unemployed man.Silly me thought I would be rewarded for being a 'good woman.' That's what he always said to me. As soon as he got another job he made himself very scarce. I was heartbroken. Thank God it now seems like a lifetime ago. Unfortunately things didn't turn out that well for him in the long run though.
TrainSen	0	you konw what? just know bullshit
TrainSen	0	Yo! Anybody add Shoenice on Facebook. He's this badass dude from NY that eats and drinks anything that is suggested towards him and puts it on Youtube. https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003979494271
TrainSen	0	Been here the whole time with this terrible team
TrainSen	0	Sounds like you should dump him.
TrainSen	0	Well! It's going to be an historic moment when Romney clinches the Republican nomination. Mitt Romney is a man of questionable legal and moral birth through his family lineage. There is no doubt he was born in the United States. But his birth--a result of family polygamy--presents an affront to the Christian heritage of this great nation. Mitt Romney's nomination shows just how far this nation has gone, in Christian moral decline.
TrainSen	0	@tboned208 yahhhhh...it wa all a false rumor! Me and dave are pretty tight. We kid each other like that all the time.
TrainSen	1	You racist bitch
TrainSen	0	Thank you J..you are so kind..Enjoy your week!
TrainSen	0	Like you.
TrainSen	0	What the fuck , Why ? I wait for 10 Min and 10 min later I muss wait 23 Hours What the fuck that is shit
TrainSen	1	You really should get other news sources and get you face out of ther gay mags.
TrainSen	0	God forbid that Applegadget uses a mouse with three buttons, oh the horrors!
TrainSen	0	You sure you arnt a pats fan? You seem to know alot about them
TrainSen	0	A hammer. A hammer works. Break in with one of those hard rubber ones, if you're a sensitive sort.
TrainSen	0	Hey Y10, great mets series, missed you all yesterday.Glad we got to use our brooms.
TrainSen	0	Why do you think that medics are more important? Many other occupations are far more vital to our wellbeing. We'd really be stuck without sanitation engineers or food providers, for example.
TrainSen	1	Possibly to get your mother and father, you twisted freak!
TrainSen	1	You people, as in "moronic filth."
TrainSen	1	All these evangelists are nothing more than money hustlers who take the weak of mind's money. I say if you are that stupid, you deserve to lose your money to them.
TrainSen	0	Maybe we, the majority who are able to stick to the rules of these boards, should act together to get rid of the trouble malkers. All it takes is 8 people to flag a comment for it to be removed and if the same people keep getting flagged, eventually the moderators will act. Enough people have liked my comment to show that there are plenty who feel the same way as me. If we work together, we can get these boards back to the way they once were.
TrainSen	1	Other? A virus isn't an organism you idiot. It's a particle. This is why we think you're stupid.
TrainSen	1	OBFan. Why are you on this board?? If you don't know that the Senate brings up the bill, AMENDS it and then votes on it, you really should be on the cartoon board not here. But do not feel bad, most people that support OB are just as dim as you are.
TrainSen	0	Number one, don't fret over weak Republicans. Number two, I have never seen people so pumped up for the election, they see the major error in voting for Obama and are chomping at the bit to correct that.Number three, simply vote the incumbent Republicans out, I have numerous ones in mind that I will send direct cash to their Republican opponents campaign.It doesn't even matter what these opponents are as long as they are verifiable in their intentions.We had a hoot with the last crop we sent in, looking for more bang for the buck in 2012.It takes multiple elections, so be it.Number four, please man, all caps is just lame.
TrainSen	0	I can't bash you on the fact you get to spend your time around (usually) attractive, (generally) unintelligent females (at least around here they are, usually give damn good head, though). However, most of the male cheerleaders I know are skinny SOBs, same with the chicks. Throwing a hundred and fifty pound dude in the air, or a hundred and twenty pound chick, is not the same as pushing/pulling around a three or four (or more) hundred pound barbell. So please, you've got what you do, we've got what we do. Don't act fucking superior and most of us wont either.
TrainSen	0	absolutely ridiculous - how many women tenors are there???
TrainSen	0	Extremist #1 :" I am tired of people meddling in mideastern affairs." Extremist #2 :" Me, too...\Let's go blow up somebody in Thailand..\That should stop it .." 
TrainSen	0	HAHAHAHAA LOOK AT THE WHITE BOY IN THE CAR WHEN HE SAID "YOU CANT FUCK WITH ME"
TrainSen	1	Fuck that...you force someone to be raped repeatedly every god damn day so your lazy ass can avoid getting a real job, beat her, imprison her, etc etc etc. and yeah every great boyfriend lets their girlfriend turn tricks--- you're fuckin sick, your mental with this way of thinking. I guess she is out of business if the next pimp knows they are dead man walking...lol... you've got to be joking - you can't really be related to this scum bag, may he burn in hell.
TrainSen	1	accused but not charged or convicted. you libbies make me laugh. especially you dimwit. you are a copy and paste monkey.
TrainSen	0	No shit!
TrainSen	0	clark just needs to stop pushing and pulling on her and just let her go, dont hate lana just because shes prettier then u
TrainSen	1	faggot
TrainSen	1	You really should be like the other Lemmings and jump off a cliff.
TrainSen	0	by your logic also legalize Heroin.
TrainSen	0	The G.O.P. can cry all they want but ther the ones that screwed up by linking all three of these programs together if they separate them now it will be a political disaster for them they will piss off the unemployed the doctors\and the seniors. The G.O.P.needs to suck it up pass the bill with all three programs until the end of the year. And let everybody know that this is the last of these programs. And\that it won't even come for a vote again. That way everybody has 10 months to\get there affairs in order by the time this ends. And congress both Democrats and the G.O.P. needs to spend the next 10 months working on there competence ethics.\\
TrainSen	0	@mikieboy - In a nutshell :-)
TrainSen	1	@Crissa:disqus LaRaza (The Race), NBP. Nation of Islam, Aztlan to name a few are very racist and very left wing. You guys are just scared to call out a black person or a hispanic for racism. I am not scared to call it like I see it. It is easy to attack whites because it makes you feel good about yourself, you think the minorities will like you if you attack whites too. Be freaking honest with yourself. This has to be one of your dumbest replies ever Crissa. I view the world through the eyes of a "Native American" as you liberals labeled us. All I see is a self loathing person who wants to feel good about herself and have others like her "because she cares". Still all I see is a person who sits on land once hunted and lived upon by the native peoples. How many thousands of Indians died so you can live where you live and feel good about yourself? Your second sentence makes no sense, because even my staunchest enemies never accuse me broad brushing. When I attack, I am very specific about my targets.
TrainSen	0	Hey, if the Republicans are determined to stake out the territory of "things really suck", they\\'re welcome to it. Should make an attractive selling feature for their 2012 nominee.
TrainSen	0	Nah. Good folks there, good music POURS from that place... don't let a couple of douchebags shape your view.
TrainSen	1	Hey nutbag..youre a traitor... Obama has more intelligence in his little finger than your peanut brain... Go to pakistan and spout your venom...youlll be murdered onn the spot...You psychos love to talk about no freedom-but you are liars... You have the freedom to speak like an idiot...arent you happy now goofball? LMAO
TrainSen	1	You're avatar is fail. Loser.
TrainSen	1	Why don't you shut your stupid mouth, pennylane? All you do is sit in here just waiting to pull the race card every chance you get. You offer nothing of value to these discussions, so why don't you just get lost? It gets tiring seeing your worthless, race-bating gibberish polluting these discussions!
TrainSen	0	We didn't even know who the rebels really are, do you really want them to have weapons they can use against us
TrainSen	1	You goofy Repub thugs don't have a clue, not the tiniest shred of a fact on how health care works in most other countries around the globe. The US is the only developed country without universal, single-payer or socialized medical care for all its citizens. Some systems differ, but all achieve near 100% access to a doctor and hospital at way lower cost than we here in The United States of America. In some countries, people pay some small amount per doctor visit, like a co-pay. In other countries, you are covered, no co-pay. In most countries, the option to have private health insurance is always an option. This gives the wealthy or well-heeded access to some private doctors who want to only see rich patients. Their choice. But no one, no mom, dad, child, uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, sister, brother, business associate, boss, garbage man, ditch digger, or nuclear physicist goes bankrupt from a disease or medical condition like here in the USA. You need not fear the collection agency coming after you because you fell and broke your arm and had no insurance. No insurance company denies your claim or drops your coverage after finding out you have cancer or heart disease or MS. Get it? We are in the dark ages of medical care in the US and the Neanderthal republicans want to keep it that way because their wealthy benefactors in the giant Insurance-Pharma industrial complex like it that way. These craven business people who lust after profits like an alcoholic lusts for a drink, make huge boatloads of cash and mega profits off us and do not want that gravy train to stop.
TrainSen	0	socaljim: Nope, Kelly should stay and stick around if we go 8-4 or 7-5 IMO. With a new QB coming in you just have that excuse. So yes, there is an excuse. It's not like we have a 4yr starter coming in and last season was a 8-4 or 9-3 record. No high expectations at all. If we surpass them then fine but if we can get at least 8 wins under this schedule and new QB it will be a success.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now with USC. If you all dont win your Conference Championship Kiffan should be fired. No excuse why you all shouldnt flat out be undefeated and in the National Championship this year. With that being said. If you all dont win the Conference it will be a huge failed season. GO ND!!!!
