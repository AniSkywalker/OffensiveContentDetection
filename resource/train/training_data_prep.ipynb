(my son is into microsoft flight simulator, so i come to aircraft articles in response to his questions and suggestions.)if it turns out that i wind up working on more of them than i expect to, i will definitely reconsider your suggestion. best, revisions of jeff manning you have a new message on my talk page. thanks! re: swine flu i'm running mozilla firefox v3.5.5 on mac os x @ 1440x900 px.

'everybody is entitled to their views', i said to myself, and moved on. i'll admit that i tended to avoid him after that as i had no wish to get embroiled in anything: i've got better things to do. i could have responded to this comment on talk:newport which i found to be deeply insulting to all welsh people: saying that daicaregos was 'an advocate of \" welsh nationality \" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). that statement left me with the indelible impression that jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all welsh people. i thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and i am sure that most welsh people would feel the same way. however, once again i did not respond even though i was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'ignore it', i told myself. shortly later i became aware of a series of edits by jza84 removing welsh nationality and replacing it with 'british' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on dafydd wigley, plaid cymru's senior statesman. rightly or wrongly, i was by then convinced that jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. i reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as i genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). however, when i saw his edit to template:welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, i will admit that i was incensed. i reacted with less tact than i should have done, i admit. i reverted his edit. changing 'welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'brittonic petty kingdoms of wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). he than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'ancient kingdoms of wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). then i read his \" explanation \" on the talk page. quite frankly i thought he was taking the mickey. it also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the welsh people their identity (quote: 'what exactly are the welsh kingdoms? kingdoms inhabited by the welsh? well, no, the welsh are a modern nation who live in wales. are they subdivisions of wales? well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date wales by centuries (wales was a concept of the future!').

      "id\t0\tpost 2001 bikes it's unclear whether the gentlemen's agreement is still in effect. i'm also unsure if mv agusta, aprilia, or bmw ever considered themselves bound by it. i've added some of the restricted 186 mph (nominal) bikes, but more need to be added. i've put in the bmw s1000rr as the new record holder, based on a test at bonneville and a number of vague claims that it went significantly over 186 mph. i'd like to see better sources on that. i'm not totally sure what to make of the results from mcn: the numbers they give for various bikes don't state in a straightfoward way whether they tested a restricted bike, a derestricted bike, or if the bike was never restricted in the first place. ultimate motorcycling is taking dictation from bmw's gary orr, owner of a dealership, that the bike reached 196 totally stock. other sources seem to kind of support this, but i'd be happier if it was more independent. is the top speed on the s1000rr governed or isn't it? what about other bikes? if i change the text to say  the 2008 bmw s1000rr has exceeded the 186 mph limit, but there has been no commentary as to what this means with respect to the gentlemen't agreement. \" is that synthesis or original research? i'd like to take a conservative approach and not accept a single claim that a bike reached a record speed, and settle on a minimum speed that multiple sources agree on. but i'm not sure what criteria to use. the alternative is to throw all claims in there and let the reader sort it out.\n",
